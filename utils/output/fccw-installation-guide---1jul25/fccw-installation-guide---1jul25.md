Introduction

Welcome to FLASHPOINT CAMPAIGNS: COLD WAR

This is a grand tactical combat simulation on the Cold War battlefield\. As the force Commander, you will plan and then issue orders and Standard Operating Procedures to your battalion, brigade, or regimental forces shaping the fight by maneuver and your intent\. Your forces will engage the enemy on rendered real\-world map locations\. Each hex is 500m of militarily significant terrain\. Each battle can last 4 to 24 hours of in\-game time\. Your troops will meet their foes any time of day and in any environment\. 

The game engine is based on asynchronous WEGO turns\. This means you will issue orders and then watch a variable amount of time unfold on the battlefield\. Then issue or adjust orders to react to what has happened as you execute your battleplan\. 

__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__ is a deep simulation of combat operations where your forces are arranged in maneuver units of companies, platoons, and sections of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry squads and teams, recon forces, engineers, air\-defense and anti\-tank systems, helicopters and more\. As the Commander, you must use available off\-map assets like long\-range artillery, rockets, or airstrikes\. 

Your efforts in this complex battlespace will be constantly challenged by modeled features like Electronic Warfare, Air Superiority, Realistic Weather, Line of Sight and Fire, Terrain and Elevation, Smoke and Mines, and Human Factors like training, morale, and readiness\. All these elements must be considered if you are to be victorious on the battlefield\. 

The game is packed with information dialogs, map overlays, and range rings to aid you as Commander, master the situation, and understand your force’s capabilities\.

__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__ is a data\-rich simulation where each nation has information on National Characteristics, Command Parameters, and Orders of Battle\. Data Tables are packed with era\-specific equipment and troops\. Weapon Systems of the time, such as guns, missiles, precision munitions, small arms, and much more, are comprehensively modeled\. 

As a toolkit, you can create your own scenarios and campaigns\. You can also dive deeper and create or modify game data, artwork, and sound effects as you see fit\. All these modding capabilities are supported by detailed documentation\.

	1. What's in This Document
This document covers all the items you need to know to install, register, uninstall this game and what hardware and software you need to run it\. Also, the names of all the fine folks who worked on this title and brought it to you are listed in the credits\. The final item is the software license agreement to cover all the bases\. If you are looking for how to run and use the game, refer to Section 1\.2 below for a listing of game manuals\.
!!! note

    __ Areas of interest or buttons on form pictures are outlined in red\.

!!! note

    __ Some images in this manual are from other versions of the game\. While your maps and units may be different, all the information and how it is used and displayed will match the information seen in this manual\.


## Manuals

We have chosen to go with many living manuals to cover game interface/play, learning the game, basic tactics, Content Creation, and Game Modding for the Cold War game engine\. We also have guides that cover that area of operations\. The affected manuals and guides will be updated as the game is updated, and PDFs of these changes will be included with the new patches\.

### The Field Manuals \(FM\)

These are the core manuals on how to play, create content for, and modify data for the Cold War game engine\. Before jumping into Content Creation, we strongly recommend you review the first three manuals, __Game Operations__, __Battlefield Primer__, and __Tutorial Operations__ if you are new to this type of game and warfare\. Returning Flashpoint Campaigns players should review __Game Operations__ to get details on new features, as there are many\. 

These documents are found in the Documents\\FMs folder\.

- FM01: Game Operations – Detailed information on the game, its interface, and how to use it
- FM02: Battlefield Primer – Fighting in the Cold War
- FM03: Tutorial Operations – How to learn and play the game
- FM04: Scenario Design – How to make or edit scenarios
- FM05: Battle Planning – How to create or edit battle plans
- FM06: Campaign Design –How to make or edit campaigns
- FM07: Map Construction –How to make simple maps for the game
- FM08: Game Engine Modifications \- How to mod elements of the game engine
- FM09: Data Structures and Editing–How to edit or build data sets
- FM10: Weather Setup – How to add in weather from other locales

### What’s New

The What’s New PDFs summarize any changes and fixes when updates are released\. 

These can be found in the Documents\\WhatsNew folder\.

### FPC Hotkeys

This PDF document lists all the unique game key presses for Function keys and all hotkey definitions\. There is no ability to rebind due to the large number of functions in the game\.

This document is in \\Documents folder\.

### Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War FAQ

To stave off forum\-clogging threads on various topics that we either don't control or can't support, we have created this FAQ document with the answers to those specific topics\.

Please review the FAQ for answers to several game topics related to the game but not on how to play the game\. 

This document is in the \\Documents folder\.

- 
	1. Gender Pronouns and Inclusion
We understand that our simulation will be played by users of all genders\. We try to keep language in the game and manual gender neutral, when possible, but sometimes use the pronoun “he” to refer to the user\. This is merely to streamline the writing and is not meant to exclude anyone or note a specific gender\. 

The On Target Simulations team supports the inclusion of all people in the field of wargaming\.

Click MY PAGE on the top and then REGISTER SERIAL on the right to register your new purchase\. 

We strongly recommend registering your game as it will give you a backup location for your serial number should you lose it in the future\.

Once you’ve registered your game, when you log in to the Members section you can view your list of registered titles by clicking My Page\.

# Unified Login System

Slitherine and Matrix now have a new “Unified Login System”\. This system allows you to access the Slitherine and Matrix Games sites using just one username and password\. 

To merge your accounts so that they work for all Slitherine Group sites, go to \(http://samelogin\.slitherine\.com/\) and enter the details of one of your accounts \(ie\. Either your Matrix or your Slitherine login\)\. 

You will then be presented with the option to merge your accounts \(listed as “\[Merge my accounts\]”\), which will then allow you to combine any other accounts you have or generate a user for another website using the exact details \(For instance, if you were called “JohnSmith123” on the Slitherine site but had no account on Matrix, you could enter the details into the site and it would create a “JohnSmith123” account for Matrix as well, with the same password as the Slitherine login\.\)
