*"Strike deep, strike fast, and disappear\."* – Air Assault Creed\.

__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__*, *Air Assault Operations involve rapidly deploying ground forces by __rotary\-wing aircraft__ \(helicopters\) into an area to __seize and hold key terrain, conduct raids, or reinforce units in combat\.__ These operations emphasize speed, mobility, and shock effects to overwhelm enemy forces before they can react effectively\.

Whether you're commanding Soviet Mi\-8s or American UH\-60s, air assault operations play the same in *Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*\. Helicopter insertions, landing zones, and air mobility are handled using identical mechanics across factions—only the unit names and aircraft models differ\.

## What are Air Assault Operations

__Air Assault Operations __are military missions in which__ combat forces are inserted, moved, or extracted by rotary\-wing aircraft, primarily helicopters,__ to engage and defeat the enemy or seize and hold key terrain\. These operations are a form of __vertical envelopment__, allowing forces to bypass enemy defenses and strike from unexpected directions\.

### Key Features of Air Assault Operations

- Helicopter\-centric: Troops and equipment are delivered by helicopters, such as the UH\-60 Black Hawk, CH\-47 Chinook, or attack helicopters like the AH\-64 Apache, which provide fire support\.
- Speed and surprise: Air assault forces can rapidly move over terrain obstacles \(such as rivers, mountains, or enemy lines\) to surprise the enemy\.
- Light, mobile units: Air assault troops are usually light infantry, optimized for mobility and short\-duration missions rather than sustained combat\.
- Precision: Designed to seize critical terrain \(e\.g\., crossroads, high ground, bridges\) or to disrupt enemy command and control\.

These features provide commanders with significant tactical advantages, enabling forces to strike quickly, achieve surprise, and accomplish complex missions across a broad range of operations\.

## Helicopter Support Units

__Helicopter Support__ refers to the use of rotary\-wing aircraft to provide various forms of assistance to ground, air, or naval forces during military operations\. This support can be categorized into several key roles, depending on the mission requirements:

- Close Air Support \(CAS\): Attack helicopters engage enemy forces in direct support of friendly ground troops\.
- Armed Reconnaissance: Armed helicopters conduct reconnaissance while being capable of engaging targets as needed\.
- Aerial Fire Support: Providing suppressive fire to assist ground maneuvers, covering troop movements, or protecting convoys\.

Helicopter support significantly enhances operational flexibility, enabling rapid responses to dynamic battlefield conditions and bridging gaps between ground and air operations\.

### Forward Arming and Refueling Point \(FARP\)

__A Forward Arming and Refueling Point \(FARP\) is a temporary, tactical facility near the front lines that provides rapid refueling and rearming support for rotary\-wing aircraft, such as helicopters__\. FARPs enable continuous air operations by reducing the time and distance aircraft need to travel to resupply, thus increasing sortie rates and operational tempo\.

### Attack Helicopter

__Attack helicopters__ are rotary\-wing aircraft designed for offensive operations against ground targets\. Their primary roles include close air support \(CAS\), anti\-tank warfare, armed reconnaissance, and suppression of enemy air defenses \(SEAD\)\. Attack helicopters are heavily armed and armored, capable of engaging a variety of threats on the battlefield\.

### Scout Helicopter

__Scout helicopters__, known as reconnaissance helicopters, are light, highly maneuverable rotary\-wing aircraft designed primarily for observation, target acquisition, reconnaissance, and command and control \(C2\) roles\. 

Their primary purpose is to gather intelligence on enemy positions, movements, and terrain, thereby supporting both ground and air operations\. While some scout helicopters are lightly armed, their key advantages are speed, agility, and stealth rather than heavy firepower\.

## Loading the Scenario
!!! note

    _


This tutorial does not have hostile ground forces, allowing players to focus on Air Assault Operations without combat pressure\.

See “__Section 7\.4, Launching the Scenario__” for instructions on starting the scenario\.

On the next screen, as shown below, you will see a list of tutorials\. Highlight __Tutorial 10 – Air Assault Operations__ and select the “__Play”__ button at the bottom of the dialog\.> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

## Review Your Forces

Before initiating air assault operations, take the time to review your airborne assets and assigned infantry units\. Confirm the readiness of transport helicopters, air assault infantry, and attached support elements, ensuring they are equipped for the planned mission\. Assess troop loadouts, flight routes, and planned landing zones to mitigate the risk of ambush or mechanical failure\. Identifying potential threats and verifying air defense suppression plans will further enhance the success of the air assault, allowing your units to deploy swiftly and secure key objectives\.
