Convoy behavior and logistics systems are identical across both factions\. While truck models and escort vehicles may differ, movement rules, ambush risk, and resupply mechanics operate the same whether you're running a NATO or Warsaw Pact convoy\.

This tutorial will cover planning, execution, and convoy security measures\.

## What are Convoy Operations

Convoy Operations involve the movement of logistics, supply, and transport units along predetermined routes to sustain combat operations\. Convoys are vulnerable and require escorts and defensive tactics for survival\.

### Key Features of Convoy Operations

1. Convoy Planning:
    - Use the Transport Planner UI to designate convoy routes and destinations\.
    - Convoys can be assigned escort units \(infantry, mechanized, or armored forces\)\.
    - Route selection is crucial to avoid ambushes and enemy interdiction\.
2. Execution of Convoy Movements:
    - Convoys move in organized formations, following assigned routes\.
    - Enemy forces may attempt ambushes, requiring defensive measures\.
    - Traffic congestion and terrain can impact convoy speed and effectiveness\.
3. Convoy Security Measures:
    - Use escort units to screen ahead, flank, and protect convoys\.
    - Maintain situational awareness to react to threats\.
    - Implement defensive stops and counter\-ambush tactics when necessary\.
4. Post\-Mission Considerations:
    - Once a convoy reaches its destination, supplies are distributed, and units redeployed\.
    - If a convoy is lost, resupply operations must be adjusted accordingly\.
    - Future convoys may require alternative routes or enhanced security measures\.
By mastering Convoy Operations, players can ensure sustained logistics flow, keeping their forces well\-supplied and mobile on the battlefield\.

## Loading the Scenario
!!! note

    _


This tutorial does not have hostile ground forces, allowing players to focus on Military Convoy Operations without combat pressure\.

See “__Section 7\.4, Launching the Scenario__” for instructions on starting the scenario\.

Select __Tutorial \#11 – Military Convoy Operations__ and click the Load button at the bottom of the dialog\.

__> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

__

Select Player 1: NATO Commander, then select Player 2: Computer Opponent\.

There will be only one enemy Battle Plan for the Warsaw Pact forces, so there is no need to make changes\.

Next, configure the __Difficulty Settings__ for the tutorial mission\. For this run\-through, we recommend disabling all settings, as shown in the image below, to ensure maximum realism\. 

__> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

__

For the best tutorial experience, follow the settings as shown above\.

Select “__Player 1: NATO Commander\.”__

I recommend using the settings shown above for the first attempt at this mission\. If that proves too challenging, try again and make the enemy units visible to aid your planning and movement\.

Select the Difficulty level at “__Grognard__”, then select the “__Play__” button to proceed to the next screen\.

Click __Load__ to start the game\. The first screen that appears is the __Scenario Description__, as shown below\. Review the mission details carefully to understand your objectives and the expectations for your forces\.

## Review Your Forces

Before starting a convoy operation, thoroughly assess the composition and readiness of the convoy units\. Review the assigned transport vehicles, escorts, and support elements, verifying vehicle loadouts, communication protocols, and convoy formation plans\. Ensure that each vehicle is prepared for potential threats, such as ambushes or roadblocks, and confirm that convoy leaders understand the movement schedule, checkpoints, and emergency response procedures\. Effective planning and coordination will keep the convoy moving safely through potentially contested terrain\.
