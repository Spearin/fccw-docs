*"If you can’t go through it, blow it up or build a bridge\."* – Sapper’s Motto\.
!!! note

    __Although NATO and Warsaw Pact engineers use different vehicles, the engineering tasks—such as breaching obstacles, placing mines, or demolishing bridges—work similarly in Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War\. Focus on the timing and sequencing of your engineering missions, not the faction\-specific tools\.


__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War *__*supports various battlefield operations, including using* engineer units to shape the battlefield through mobility, survivability, and fortification tasks\. Engineer units are crucial in constructing defensive positions, clearing obstacles, breaching enemy fortifications, and laying minefields to control key terrain\.

This tutorial focuses on Engineer Operations and details how these units can be effectively deployed and utilized to enhance battlefield effectiveness\.

## What are Engineer Operations

Engineer operations utilize specialized engineering units to manipulate the battlefield environment, supporting friendly forces or hindering enemy movement\. These operations can be defensive \(such as fortifications and mine laying\) or offensive \(including breaching and obstacle clearance\)\.

###  Key Features of Engineer Operations:

1. Engineering Tasks and Capabilities:
    - Obstacle Breaching: Engineers clear enemy minefields, roadblocks, and other obstacles to ensure unit mobility\.
    - Fortifications & Fieldworks: Engineers construct defensive positions to improve unit survivability\.
    - Bridge Construction/Destruction: Some scenarios allow engineers to build or demolish bridges, affecting force mobility\.
2. Using Engineer Units Effectively:
    - Engineers must be positioned near the designated engineering task to begin their operation\.
    - Tasks such as clearing fortifications or breaching take time, so planning is essential\.
    - Units assigned to breaching operations must have the necessary engineering support and be protected from enemy interference\.
3. Execution of Engineer Operations:
    - Engineers receive orders to conduct a specific task 
    - They must complete their task before units can utilize their efforts\.
    - Supporting units should secure the area to ensure the successful execution of engineering missions\.
4. Post\-Operation Considerations:
    - Engineer units can be repositioned after completing tasks to support additional objectives\.
    - Defensive structures and minefields remain in place throughout the battle, shaping the engagement area\.
    - Engineers should be protected, as they are essential force multipliers vulnerable in direct combat\.
## Engineer Units and Vehicles

In this tutorial, we’ll explore the engineering platforms\. To access the following information, highlight the unit and open the Dashboard \(F4\) and the Subunit Inspector \(F6\)\.

### Engineers

Engineers are specialized military forces responsible for supporting mobility, counter\-mobility, survivability, and general engineering tasks on the battlefield\. 

Their roles are crucial in offensive and defensive operations\. They enable troops to maneuver effectively while impeding the enemy’s movement\.

#### Roles in Combat for the Engineers

- Mobility Support—Constructs roads, clears obstacles, and provides bridge solutions to ensure friendly forces can advance\.
- Counter\-Mobility – Slowing or stopping enemy advances through fortifications, minefields, and demolition operations\.
- Survivability – Constructing defensive positions, bunkers, and obstacles to protect forces and personnel\.
- Assault Breaching – Supporting frontline troops in breaching enemy defenses through demolition and mine clearance\.

### Combat Engineer Vehicles

Combat Engineer Vehicles \(CEVs\) are specialized armored vehicles designed to support combat engineers in battlefield operations\. 

Their primary roles include breaching obstacles, clearing mines, constructing fortifications, and supporting mobility and counter\-mobility tasks\. Both NATO and the Soviet Union developed various Combat Engineer Vehicles \(CEVs\) to enhance their operational effectiveness in mechanized warfare\.

#### Roles in Combat for the CEV

- Obstacle Breaching & Removal – CEVs were used to clear minefields, break through enemy obstacles, and remove debris blocking movement\.
- Mine Clearing – Some CEVs had mine plows or rollers to clear paths through minefields\.
- Bridge Layer Support: Assist bridge\-laying vehicles by preparing crossing sites and removing obstacles to ensure safe and efficient operations\.
- Construction & Demolition – Excavation for fighting positions, road repair, and destruction of enemy fortifications\.
- Defensive Fortifications – Digging trenches, tank ditches, and setting up barriers\.

###  Armored Vehicle\-Launch Bridge \(AVLB\)

Armored Vehicle Launch Bridges \(AVLBs\) are specially designed vehicles that deploy portable bridges, allowing troops and vehicles to cross obstacles such as rivers, ditches, and damaged infrastructure\. 

These vehicles are crucial in mobility and sustaining operational momentum, especially in mechanized warfare\.

#### Roles in Combat for the AVLB

- Rapid Mobility Support – deploying bridges to help mechanized forces cross obstacles quickly\.
- Tactical Flexibility \-  enabling maneuver units to bypass chokepoints or destroyed bridges\.
- Armored Protection – providing bridge\-laying capability while under potential enemy fire\.
- Logistics Support – assisting in rear\-area movement of reinforcements and supply convoys\.

## Breaching, Clearing, and Demolition

In Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War, combat engineers play a critical role in shaping the battlefield by conducting essential breaching and clearing operations\. They breach obstacles such as wire, barricades, and roadblocks to open pathways for advancing units, employing demolition charges, Bangalore torpedoes, and specialized equipment\. 

Simultaneously, they breach minefields by identifying, marking, and neutralizing mines to establish safe lanes for friendly forces, utilizing mine plows, rollers, and explosive line charges\. 

Engineers also clear improved positions by dismantling or neutralizing enemy fortifications, such as bunkers and trenches, ensuring the area is secure for friendly occupation\. When necessary, they execute demolition operations to destroy bridges, strategically denying the enemy key crossing points while coordinating detonations to align with overall mission objectives\.

### Breaching Obstacles

Breaching Obstacles is a systematic process involving clearing, bypassing, or reducing barriers—natural or man\-made—that impede military operations and movement\. 

Common obstacles include enemy fortifications, minefields, barbed wire, tank ditches, roadblocks, and urban rubble\. Effective breaching is critical in maneuver warfare to ensure freedom of movement for friendly forces, maintain operational tempo, and sustain momentum during offensive actions\.

### Breach Minefields

Breaching minefields involves detecting, marking, and removing or neutralizing mines to enable safe passage for friendly forces and equipment\. 

Combat engineers typically perform this task using specialized equipment and procedures such as mine detectors, mine\-clearing line charges \(MICLIC\), mechanical clearing vehicles, or manual clearance techniques\. 

Utilize engineer units to systematically clear minefields, prioritizing critical avenues of approach to maintain tactical mobility and operational momentum\. Clearing operations can also involve explosive breaching methods to create lanes through minefields during combat quickly\.

### Clearing Improved Position

In Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War, engineers can clear improved positions by dismantling or neutralizing enemy fortifications, including bunkers, trenches, and other defensive structures\. 

This operation involves removing physical barriers, explosive devices, and any remaining enemy presence to secure the area for friendly forces to occupy or maneuver through\.

### Destroying Bridges

In Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War, destroying a bridge is a deliberate engineering operation to deny the enemy a critical crossing point\. This involves placing and detonating demolition charges at key structural points to collapse the bridge, rendering it impassable\. The operation may also include setting time\-delay fuses or remote detonations to coordinate with the tactical plan\.

## Starting the Mobility Operations

However, before we proceed, let's review the steps to understand better what you are tasked with doing\. You have already read the Mission Brief\.
!!! note

    __ This tutorial does not have hostile ground forces, allowing players to focus on Engineer Operations without combat pressure


The first step is to review the Mission Overlay to understand the battlefield layout better\. From the Menu, select "__Staff__," then choose "__Import__ __Mission Graphics from Briefing__" to display the provided graphics, as shown below\. 

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



The screen will appear as shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



The bottom center of the screenshot displays your unit, which is represented by a NATO symbol for a Combat Engineer unit\. For this tutorial, you will notice black arrows showing where you will move your forces\. Each numbered circle is the phase number for each task you will do\. 

Additionally, map makers are included on the overlay to indicate the locations of suspected minefields, obstacles, and improved positions on the map\.

Next, we want to open the Staff TOC Operations and select the “__Engineering”__ tab\.

As shown in the screenshot below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



We will provide more details during the phases\. You may keep this tutorial on your monitor to observe\.

### Phase 1: Deploying an AVLB to Bridge a River

Phase 1 of the Mobility Operations focuses on executing a Wet Gap Crossing to establish a secure bridgehead for follow\-on forces\. The objective is to transport designated units across the water obstacle using AVLBs, engineer boats, and amphibious vehicles while maintaining tactical cohesion and suppressing enemy interference\.

 All units must adhere to established movement routes and control measures to prevent congestion and maintain operational tempo\. 

Upon securing the far bank, units will consolidate, establish a defensive perimeter, and prepare for subsequent phases\.

Select the Combat Engineer unit and move it to the designated riverbank\. Hold down the __Ctrl key__, left\-click it, and drag it to create a box\. All units within the box will then be selected\. Plot your movement now\.

Have the artillery battery lay a smoke screen on the west bank, concealing the AVLB laying the bridge\. Select the A/2\-3 FA battery on the OOB tree and right\-click to bring up the following screen, as shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



You will notice that this artillery battery has 96 rounds of HE, 96 rounds of FASCAM, and 96 rounds of Smoke, indicating that this artillery unit can fire a Smoke mission and a FASCAM mission\. And you will also notice that FSCC controls the unit\. However, we want to override the FSCC and fire smoke rounds on the other side of the river\. At the blue highlight, right\-click to get a screen as shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Select the word __Barrage,__ and a pop\-up screen appears where you plot the location where the rounds will hit\. Then click on the “__Commit”__ button\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



The next screen will show you the type of mission it is set for\. We want to change the Mission Preset to 'Smoke—Visible', as displayed on the screen below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Here, you can adjust the number of rounds, the time of impact, and the duration\. We will leave it as shown in the screenshot above\. Then click on the “__Apply”__ button to confirm this Fire Mission\. Go ahead and exit\. 

With planning complete, orders issued, and SOPs adjusted, it’s time to commence the battle\. Adjust the map zoom to 80 percent or lower for a more comprehensive battlefield view\. Use the mini\-map to navigate and position the main map in the lower left corner for optimal visibility during the engagement\.

Before proceeding, consider saving the game to secure your setup in case of unexpected issues\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



When ready, click the “__Start__” button in the upper right corner to initiate the battle\. The game will resolve the next 15 minutes of game time, advancing to the next Orders Phase\. If the operation proceeds as planned, the engineer units will move toward the river during this initial phase\.

As you can see from the screenshot shown above, the engineering units have moved and have not yet completed the movement orders\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



However, the M60 AVLB is close enough to the riverbank that I can order it to lay a bridge over the river by selecting the “Build Bridge” button, as shown above\. Then, select the “S__tart”__ button again for another 15\-minute turn\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



As shown in the screenshot above, I have only two eligible locations to build a bridge\. One is located in the northeast corner, and the other is in the southwest corner\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



The screenshot above shows where the bridge will be built at the Northeast corner, as indicated by the Hex Grids, along with the estimated time required to complete the build\.

You can also go to the Staff TOC Operations and select the “__Engineering”__ tab for the same information as shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Referring to the screenshot above, the first red box shows which M60 AVLBs are loaded with a bridge, and which ones are not\.

As shown on the screen below, the map marker indicating that the bridge is being constructed can barely be made out\.

 > **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

This is what the symbol for a bridge being laid looks like on the map\. Once it is complete, it will look like the one shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



The bridge building is complete\. The Engineer Report will now show that the 2/M60 AVLB bridge is deployed\.

Once the bridge is laid, move Combat Engineers vehicles across the deployed bridge\.

Select all the Engineer units to cross the bridge\. After crossing over, place the 2/M60 AVLB just northwest of the bridge so that the M60 AVLB can retrieve the bridge for another use if needed\. You don’t want to leave an unattended bridge for the enemy to use\.

Once crossing is complete, select the AVLB and cross over the bridge, and use the “__Remove Bridge__” command to deny enemy use and link back up to the Combat Engineer Platoon\.

Right\-click on the M60 AVLB and select the “__Remove Bridge__” as shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



When you select “__Remove Bridge,” __a screen will appear as shown above\. Select the “__Bridge”__ button, which will change to “__Recovering__” as shown below\. This will display the location and estimated time required to recover the bridge\. Then, select the “__Proceed”__ button\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



As the M60AVLB recovers the bridge, the Combat Engineers will move North to the suspected minefields\.

To ensure that you give orders to the M60 AVLB, right\-click on the unit and select the “__Unit Dashboard__,” which will display the orders given\. As shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



At 0850, Security 01 moved up to B8, spotting enemy obstacles\. At 0901, they spotted improved positions, as shown in the unit log\. However, as shown above in the screenshot of the Unit Log, they cannot detect any minefields\.

The M60 AVLB recovered the bridge and is moving to reestablish contact with the Combat Engineer platoon\.

### Phase 2: Removing a Minefield

After successfully constructing the bridge over the river and getting the Combat Engineer platoon across, move the Combat Engineer Unit to the suspected enemy minefield\. 
!!! note

    __ The Map Markers on the overlay do not indicate the locations of the minefields\. You will not know where the minefield is located unless you drive over it\.


The best approach is to stop short of what is shown on the overlay and send one engineer squad or a CEV to locate the minefield\.

Upon reaching the minefield, engineers will initiate breaching operations using standard explosive and mechanical methods to create a clear lane for advancing units\. Priority is given to establishing a primary breach lane with sufficient width to accommodate armored and mechanized assets\. 

Engineer teams will utilize Bangalore torpedoes, mine plows, and other breaching assets to neutralize obstacles and mark safe lanes for follow\-on forces\. 

Position the Combat Engineer Squad at the suspected minefield location\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



CEV will use the “__Move Deliberate__” order because there may be mines in the next hex, and the only way to confirm their presence is for the CEV to drive over them\. 

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



1/CEV spotted mines once it drove over the minefield, as shown above\.

Issue the "__Lift Mines__" command\. At 1052hrs, mines were lifted by 1/CEV\. As shown in the screenshot below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Because the unit is still on the minefield, you can go to the top ribbon, select “__Counters__,” select “__Hide Unit Counters__” from the drop\-down box, and see if it has finished\. Below is an example of a reduced minefield\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Monitor progress, as breaching a minefield is time\-intensive and may draw enemy fire\.

### Phase 3: Removing an Obstacle 

After the minefield is successfully cleared, engineers will focus on removing the remaining obstacles that could impede follow\-on forces\. 

Engineers will use specialized equipment and demolition assets to systematically remove or neutralize obstacles, ensuring clear lanes for advancing units\. Priority will be given to high\-threat areas such as roadblocks, tank traps, and wire entanglements\. 

Coordination with security elements will be maintained throughout to prevent enemy interference and protect engineer teams during clearance operations\.

Select a combat engineer squad and move them to the target location\.

Select the “__Remove Obstacle__” command to remove enemy barriers as shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



The Unit Log records the time at which obstacles are removed\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

To the left is the symbol for a reduced obstacle\.

### Phase 4: Removing Improved Position

After removing the obstacle, send another combat engineer squad and a CEV to the spotted Improved Position\.  Upon reaching the designated improved position, the engineer units will begin clearing to dismantle enemy fortifications\. This phase involves using demolition charges, heavy equipment, and manual tools to systematically reduce bunkers, fighting positions, and other defensive structures\. Engineers will coordinate with adjacent units to ensure the area is secure before commencing demolition operations\. Once cleared, the area will be marked for follow\-on forces to occupy or bypass as the operational plan requires\.

Use the same procedure as in __Section 7\.6\.3, Removing an Obstacle\.__

Once complete, the map marker for IP will disappear from the map\.

### Phase 5: Engineers Destroying a Bridge

While the Combat Engineer Squad and CEV move to remove the improved position, another combat engineer squad with Security will proceed to the designated bridge demolition site\. The objective is to sever the enemy’s critical lines of communication and impede their ability to reinforce or withdraw\. 

Coordination with security elements will be maintained throughout the operation to prevent enemy interference during the detonation phase\.

Move a combat engineer squad \(in M113s\) to the target bridge location and destroy the bridge\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Have the artillery battery lay a smoke screen on the river's east bank\. Dismount near the bridge under cover\. 

Select the engineer squad and issue the “__Remove Bridge__” command\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



The symbol for a blown bridge is shown above when the bridge is blown\. 

### Phase 6: Artillery Scatterable Mines

After completing the bridge's destruction, engineers will request artillery\-delivered scatterable mines to reinforce key areas and disrupt potential enemy counterattacks\. Target areas will be designated based on expected enemy avenues of approach and tactical objectives\. Engineers will coordinate with artillery units to establish precise fire missions, ensuring proper placement of scatterable mines while minimizing risk to friendly forces\. Once the minefields are laid, engineers will reposition to support subsequent operations as directed\.

Select your artillery unit capable of firing scatterable mines\.

Target key enemy routes or chokepoints\. Instead of using “Smoke—Visible” as we did for smoke rounds, we will change it to “__Minelet Deployment__\.”

The map marker is a different color from blue or red, making it easier to see on the map\.
