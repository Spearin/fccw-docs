# Surviving Modern Warfare

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


The battlefield in the late Cold War and beyond is a very unforgiving and lethal mistress\. During WW II, it was not uncommon for a tank that was put out of action by enemy fire to be repaired and returned to service, with the effort and time being well short of a factory rebuild\. Desert Storm and the Ukraine War show that those days are long past\. Even the development and fielding of things like ACA, ERA, and APS only slightly mitigate the immense shift from combat damage to catastrophic kill\.

Overall, time is compressed compared to WW II\. Armored formations can cover ground much quicker than in the 1940s, and radio communications are distributed at every command level\. Commanders have a much clearer picture of the battlefield\.

Artillery is much more accurate and can serve missions much faster\. Artillery was, and still is, the King of Battle\.

## Force Ratios

The classic ratio for success has been a 3:1 attacker advantage\. This stemmed from Historical Analysis of conflicts where, by and large, throughout the world, major armies had no significant offsets to one another\. They had about the same troop quality and battlefield capabilities\.

WW II saw the effect of tactical\-level offsets, particularly in tank performance and troop quality versus mass\.

In the late Cold War and beyond, offsets in various platform capabilities and troop quality grew more pronounced\. There are examples of numerically inferior forces handily defeating larger forces while attacking\.

The effect of these offsets \(weapon range, lethality, sensor capability, and troop quality\) results in it being entirely possible to operate outside the Lanchester range of 1:6 to 6:1\. For example, given the right set of circumstances, a company can defeat an attack by a regiment \(a 1:9 force ratio\)\. This situation is absent from the traditional "force multipliers" of artillery and combat engineering\.

## Tempo

A unit can't turn on a dime\. Even individual soldiers can't do that in most cases\. Send an experienced, well\-trained soldier off to make contact with an adjacent unit at the Contact Point, and that soldier, even knowing where he is and where he is going, needs to look at a map and choose a safe route\. And that gets more complicated as you add more moving parts, like Squads, Vehicles, and Platoons\. This tempo is Command Delay\. Give an order, and there will be some interval of time before the unit starts to execute\. 

Commanders and their Staff track the battle, getting reports of contact, casualties, and BDA\. That's data, and the Staff's job is to turn that into actionable information for the Commander's decisions\. That takes time, and that time is part of the Command Cycle\.

The upshot of all this is, as the Commander, you, the Player, can only give orders so often, and when you do, things won't start moving in your intended direction for some minutes \(perhaps over an hour\)\.

You are in a dangerous situation if you are surprised during your fight\.

## Combined Arms Battle

Some nations use the term "All Arms" with this concept\. The core of an Army is its Combat Arms – Infantry, Artillery, and Armor\. The idea is about using multiple *mutually supporting* Combat Arms in a battle\. This concept did not start in WWI when tanks were fielded on the battlefield\. It goes back at least to the Thirty Years War \(Gustavus Adolphus\)\. Let's dissect things and look at the Combat Arms and how their contributions on the battlefield\.

One can view this as a triad consisting of an Arm with very high mobility, another with very high lethality, and another with very high survivability, with each of these characteristics compared to the others\. This view has held up well over the ages\.

### Artillery

The US Army calls this the "King of Battle"\. That stems from the fact that artillery is the greatest producer of casualties, not just soldiers\. It's armored vehicles, too, even in the Ukraine War\. But that is not the main benefit of artillery\. The large casualty production is the mechanism that affects one's enemy and the execution of the enemy's plan matters\. 

While it can require a relatively large expenditure of ammunition and take considerable time to annihilate a unit employing artillery, the large number of immediate casualties inflicted on a unit with the initial rounds can degrade the target unit's effectiveness\. In some cases, take it entirely out of the fight for a period ranging from minutes to days \(requiring replacements to be assigned\)\. 

This impact is why artillery preps are fired at "likely" enemy positions just before an assault and why there is such a thing as a Final Protective Fire\. The most important effect of artillery fires is disrupting current enemy activities\.

### Infantry

The "Queen of Battle" is the name given to the infantry\. The infantry's mission is to close with and destroy the enemy\. It is the one Combat Arm that can seize, clear, and hold any terrain type\.

There are several types of infantries, mainly varying in mobility – leg \(they walk\), motorized/mechanized \(moving about the battlefield in trucks, APCs, or IFVs\), and airmobile \(moving via helicopter\)\. But when it comes to seizing and holding terrain, the infantry is the source of the phrase "boots on the ground"\.

Infantry is predominantly a close\-range Arm, typically having its greatest combat power at ranges under 300 meters\. Some infantry units have medium\-strength anti\-armor weapons, but generally, these range to around 1000m\.

Infantry shines when deployed in complex terrain \(those locations with a high Cover value\) and often require infantry or sustained intense artillery barrages to dislodge them from such areas\.

### Armor

The "Arm of Decision" has its roots in horse cavalry\. Cavalry is the Combat Arm with the most significant mobility \(across all subtypes within each\), and it is that mobility that provides a Commander with the Arm's most considerable capability\. 

It's tempting not to equate the horse cavalry of old with tank units today, but that is mainly in error\. The cavalry of the pre\-WWI era had several battlefield missions – reconnaissance, envelopment, flank attacks, and security\. One of the critical attributes of cavalry actions was the shock effect\. Tanks certainly have a rich history of that\.

In the WW II era and later, we see tank units having the most impact on combat operations when used as an exploitation force\. During WW II, they were frequently used to conduct "break\-in" attacks versus prepared defenses\. The results were mixed and looked to be mixed at best\. Yes, tanks and break in\. You do need enough tanks\.

The most successful uses of armor seem to be to bypass, flank, or otherwise maneuver faster than the opponent can reposition to counter these actions\.

Modern tanks \(post\-WWII\) have a good combination of mobility, lethality, and protection\. Still, they cannot function in all terrain \(swamps, heavy forest, urban areas\) and, unlike old horse cavalry, can't seize and clear terrain well \(see Buford at Gettysburg on Day 1\)\. Dismounted infantry in and amongst tanks can make a tanker lose sleep\.

## Battlefield Functions and Activities

The battlefield, and battles, can be viewed as a collection of tactical activities\. It can be helpful, both in planning and execution, to categorize these activities\.

### Intelligence

Intelligence has been defined as "gathering information\." A view more helpful to the Player is the result of considering the meaning of data provided by the game\. These data include ground unit spotting reports, radio intercepts, and radar detections\. 

The Player's task here is to use that data with knowledge about the enemy's composition, organization, and likely objectives to "paint a picture" of the battlefield at any instant\.

Some data is beyond the Player's ability to control or influence \(radio intercept and radar detection\)\. There is a lot the Player can plan to do and execute to enhance data collection\. The Player uses units to do this\. At first blush, one's attention goes to the reconnaissance units in the Player's forces\. The reality is any maneuver unit should be viewed as an asset to accomplish this crucial task\.

### Reconnaissance

Closely related to Intelligence is Reconnaissance, which provides data for the Intelligence staff to turn into actionable information for the Commander\. Recon is probably the most challenging aspect of playing this game, let alone in the real world\.

#### Combat Reconnaissance

First, as a Player, don't limit your thinking of Reconnaissance to "where do I move/place my Recon units\." In addition to your dedicated recon units \(recon companies, scout platoons, etc\.\), the Player needs to think about Combat Recon\. That is, the use of front\-line combat units to perform reconnaissance tasks\.

A prime example is a template the WP used when advancing to contact\. The Advance Guard for a regiment, one of the regiment's battalions, used the basic concept of reaching the enemy using only a single subordinate element\. This detachment provides the commander with the option to attack the contact or bypass it, and this pattern is common to all modern armies\. The Soviets thoughtfully provided an easy\-to\-understand template for this\.

The use of a single subordinate element to make contact is carried down to the platoon level: the Advance Guard Main Body \(AGMB, battalion strength\) detaches a Forward Security Element \(company strength\), which detaches a Combat Recon Patrol \(platoon strength\)\. This last level is the recon part of the force\.

#### Recon Composition and Strength

We can broadly classify recon units into Light patrols and Heavy Patrols\. Light means less than platoon strength and is often equipped with machine guns for armament\. Heavy patrols will be either IFVs or tanks in platoon strength\.

Compared to the parent formation, a recon formation is typically 10% or less of total strength\. The recon element is often two levels of command down from the owning formation\. A Brigade/Regiment has a recon company, and a battalion has a recon platoon\.

#### Recon Use

Heavy patrols are used for route recon of the axis of advance of a force\. These have enough lethality and survivability to eliminate enemy recon forces and prevent them from detecting the leading elements of the friendly formation\. Another use of a heavy patrol is as a recon reserve\. It follows the line of light patrols and can be used to overcome the enemy's light resistance or counter\-recon efforts\.

Light patrols should be used to discover potential infiltration or bypass routes or to find enemy rear area assets\. This action means using paths that are through high cover and concealment\.

Do not use recon assets to find the enemy front\-line trace\. You will find it and mark it with casualties\.

Also, remember that not finding the enemy is incredibly useful for your recon forces\.

### Security

There are two fundamental missions at the level of this game\. These are Screen \(not to be confused with the Screen order\. Which is the order to give units doing a Screen type mission\. That is a unit posture\.\) and Cover/Guard \(We'll use Cover here\. The nuance is Cover means the protected unit does not support, either logistically or by artillery, and Guard means the protected unit provides both\)\.

A Screen is simply a chain of observers that provide early warning\. It's an everyday use of recon elements to provide flank security\. A screen need not be static\. Having the patrols move laterally while screening can give significantly more width of coverage at the expense of timeliness of reporting\. Combat patrols are not often used for screening, as the geometry usually does not allow prompt re\-purposing of those patrols to a pure combat role\.

Cover is typically used to provide time for the covered formation to prepare for the upcoming fight\. This will usually be the focus of an entire scenario in the game\. The covering force executes its mission using defense, delay, or attacks to cause the enemy to have to deal with the covering force, thus delaying the enemy's attack or advance to contact with the friendly main body\. 

A subset of Cover is Counter\-Recon\. These are actions designed to purposely hunt and destroy enemy recon elements to prevent the discovery of the friendly main body\.

### Maneuver

Maneuver is about positioning forces and using their direct fire on the enemy\. It's not about "moving" units\. There will be situations where the Player needs to have a unit at a particular location\. That could mean getting a unit back at that location or another unit taking its place if forced off it\. Think geometry or shaping\. 

Obviously, maneuvering involves moving units, too\. How much depends entirely on the situation, both from a mission aspect and the reaction to enemy contact\. Attack a discovered enemy or bypass it? That depends on the mission, and there is no general "rule of thumb" to consult\. 

Attacks will involve a lot of movement and decisions about what to do upon enemy contact\. The defense will likely require less movement of units as part of the primary plan, but the employment of the reserve as well as contingency plans to introduce movement\. Static defenses overwhelmingly fail\.

### Fire Support

We stress again that the most helpful contribution by artillery is the degradation of effectiveness a target undergoes\. It's not about simply racking up kills, though that will happen\. It's about supporting the other two Arms in their missions, whether breaking up an enemy attack or suppressing enemy defenders\.

The standard ratio of artillery to its supported unit is a battery \(6 to 8 tubes\) per maneuver battalion\. Specific missions may see more artillery assets, particularly deliberate attacks against a well\-prepared defense\. 

In that mission, where minefields and counter\-mobility obstacle belts are to be breached, it is common to see an artillery battery firing missions in support of a company\-sized element\. So, an entire artillery battalion may be tasked with supporting a single maneuver battalion during the break\-in\.

Time and space need to be considered when planning fire support\. Many systems will not cover the entire map, necessitating repositioning\. Another thing to prepare for is ensuring your artillery units are full of ammo when the heavy fight begins\.

### Air Defense

Air Defense is an area where there is quite a bit of difference from nation to nation\. Even so, some generalities at the NATO vs\. WP level are relevant\. 

High to Medium Range Air Defense \(HIMAD\): These are the medium to long\-range \(>10 km\) SAM systems\. NATO's primary air defense across the theater was its air forces\. NATO HIMAD SAM systems were positioned in belts extending as far forward as the rear of Corps sectors and aren't portrayed in the game\. WP had HIMAD systems at the Division level, but even these would not be so far forward as to appear on the game map\. HIMAD capabilities are part of the Air Superiority setting for each side\.

Short Range Air Defense \(SHORAD\): Short\-range systems were used by both NATO and WP and included both SAM and gun systems\. Not all nations used both types throughout the Cold War\. NATO tended to have SHORAD units at the Division level and parcel them out according to mission needs\. These systems were to be used to help ensure the Brigade/Regiment/Battalion Commander's freedom of maneuver\. NATO did not deploy SHORAD in sufficient density to provide an "umbrella" effect\. WP had SHORAD platoons organic to motorized rifle battalions \(MANPADS SAMs\) and a battery of both gun and SAM systems at the regiment level\.

Air Defense assets are a scarce battlefield resource, and no one, not even WP formations, can always protect everything\. Both factions recognized that, and the driving principle for air defense is to preserve the commander's freedom of maneuver\. And this does not necessarily mean "protect the only line units\." The Player needs to apply METT\-T \(Mission, Enemy, Terrain, Troops available, Time, and Civilian considerations\) to this decision\.

### Engineering

There are three crucial ways combat engineering \(as opposed to construction engineering, which is building facilities\) contributes to the fight:

- Mobility – This is gap crossing \(rivers, ditches, obstacles, and minefields\)\.
- Counter\-mobility – This is "obstacles" and bridge demolition\. Professionally speaking, both the in\-game "obstacle" and "minefield" are classified as obstacles\. These are used to shape the battlefield to enhance terrain to the commander's advantage\.
- Survivability – Combat engineer assets in the real world can significantly shorten the time needed to prepare a defensive position\. Digging positions is not within the time scope of a scenario, so this capability is not in the game\.

#### Bridging

Engineer units have bridging assets for wet gap \(river\) crossing\. The WP realized they would have to bridge a wet gap on average every 25 km\. Thus, WP battalions had bridging equipment as part of the line battalion kit\. At the regiment level, there was more, but not the hardened kind\. Line battalions would bridge, cross, and then recover bridges\. Regimental level bridges would be emplaced to establish a supply route\.

NATO bridging requirements were much less and were more about deciding when to demolish east\-west bridges after NATO was done using them to move westward\. NATO recognized the need for crossing the Rhine by REFORGER reinforcements at non\-highway points, so there were units dedicated to that mission \(often ferry units of the Bundeswehr\)\.
!!! note

    __ REFORGER is Exercise Campaign REFORGER \(from REturn of FORces to [GERmany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany)\) was an annual [exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise) and campaign conducted by NATO during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War)\. The training was intended to ensure that NATO could quickly deploy forces to [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany) in a conflict with the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact)\.


#### Obstacles and Minefields

Obstacles in the game are to be viewed as reinforced triple\-strand concertina wire\. In actual practice, these can be breached with wire cutters, explosives, or blades \(engineer dozer type or tank\-mounted mine plows\)\. 

Obstacles and minefields can be breached by combat engineers, infantry, and tanks \(with the appropriate plows installed\)\. WP tank companies are nothing but tanks, so each tank platoon had one tank with a mine plow\. The reason for this is described below\.

There are two styles of this: In Stride and Deliberate\. "In Stride" does what it sounds like – a unit breaches using assigned assets without pausing to wait for another unit \(infantry or engineer\) to move forward to breach\. This form of breaching imposes the slightest delay and is why WP tank platoons carry one plow per platoon\. The downside is that only the breaching unit may use the resulting lane\.

Deliberate breaches are more involved and are planned as part of a mission\. Any unit may use a deliberate breach\. This is a result of not only other units being notified of the breach location, but the lanes are handed over to each crossing unit, meaning a guide is present on the ground, and units coordinate for the transfer of "ownership"\. The downside is that executing a Deliberate Breach consumes more time\.

Typically, a battalion requires two breach sites \(meaning two separate breach hexes in a belt\) to pass through an obstacle/minefield belt with a minimal delay once the lanes are established\.

### Spectrum Warfare

__*Content to be added before release*__\.

### Command and Control

As a Player, you have three things to pay attention to regarding Command and Control \(C2\): your Command Cycle, Command Delay, and Command Range\.

#### Command Cycle

The Command Cycle is the amount of time between opportunities to issue orders\. It starts and 15 minutes of game time and gets longer from there, depending on several factors\. First is the force structure in terms of the ratio of HQ to other units\. Losing the highest HQ unit will increase the Command Cycle\. The Electronic Warfare \(EW\) burden contributes to the force's average unit Readiness\.

#### Command Delay

Command Delay is the time between issuing an order to a unit and the unit beginning to execute its order\. Some things can delay this\. Most are about getting the order to the unit\. Another bit is how much time the unit takes to transition from its current order to the new order\.

- Whether the ordered unit's immediate HQ is moving, under fire, or firing
- Ordered unit's direct HQ's Readiness, Initiative level, and Training
- The EW level at the time of the order
- If the order starts or takes the ordered unit out of its immediate HQ Command Range
- Transition time depends on what the current order is for the ordered unit compared to the new order\. 

#### Command Range

Command Range has a significant impact on maneuver flexibility\. Not only does Command Range have a possible effect on Command Delay, but you can't even issue an Assault order to a maneuver unit outside Command Range\.

Of note is the fact that Recon units may operate normally outside of the Command Range of their headquarters\. This means they suffer no Command Delay owing to a distant HQ\. An isolated line unit may struggle to move back to its parent unit's area\.

Command Range is not just a function of the type of radios in an HQ unit, though that is part of the picture\. The other part is how much of the battlefield that HQ level is responsible for and thus trained to control\. So, the higher the echelon of command for the HQ, the larger the Command Range\.

## Missions

While there are many mission types \(Hasty Attack, Deliberate Attack, Breakout from Encirclement, etc\.\), this being a Primer, we will focus on three fundamental missions\. The more nuanced mission types are either basic ones done under particular circumstances or have a limited and desired outcome\.

### Advance to Contact

Also known as Movement to Contact or Attack from the March is defined as the following actions:

- This mission has an objective to seize
- Enemy contact is expected
- The enemy's location is unknown
- You will likely need to react to enemy contact by maneuver

The above characterization of this kind of fight drives planning to a set of principles:

- Make initial contact with the smallest force possible
- Preserve your freedom of maneuver\.   A battalion bumping into a platoon does not warrant a battalion\-level attack\. Maintain the option to bypass disruption forces\.
- Keep in mind that disengaging from contact often results in casualties\.

### Defend

Defense is much more than simply piling forces on a piece of ground the enemy wishes to seize\. An attack is very complex and affords a defender many opportunities to wreck the attack plan\. First, an attacker must approach the objective\(s\)\. Making an attacker fight en route to his attack before all his pieces are set in place will disrupt the plan and timetable\. Some points to keep in mind are:

- This mission has one or more objectives to defend
- Once your enemy spots your defensive positions, artillery will rain down
- A competent enemy attack will be preceded by reconnaissance\. Kill it\. Make a counter\-recon plan\.
- Infantry is tenacious in complex terrain\. They are simply targets if you select a beet field to dig in\.
- Small arms are in\-the\-same\-hex weapons\. An excellent technique is the "reverse slope"\. This means your defending infantry is not visible until the enemy is adjacent\.
- Unspotted units that open fire have fire superiority\. It may make perfect sense, especially when using the reverse slope, to set infantry to fire at point\-blank range \(meaning in the same hex\)\. This can be devastating to enemy infantry and armored vehicles when your infantry has light AT weapons and is in complex terrain\.

### Attack

This is the most complex mission for several reasons\. First, there are more units you need to engage\. Second, there will likely be situations to deal with as the attacking forces approach the objective before making the assault\. And probably the hardest is synchronizing reconnaissance, various maneuver elements, and fire support efforts\. Some areas to give particular attention to:

- Attack from multiple directions at the same time
- Perform reconnaissance of the approach as well as the objective itself\.
- Find and destroy defender reconnaissance elements before spotting the attacking maneuver forces\.
- Select assault positions for ground elements that will seize objectives\. These are close to the objective, but not within line of sight\.
- Use artillery preps to degrade defenders' effectiveness\.
