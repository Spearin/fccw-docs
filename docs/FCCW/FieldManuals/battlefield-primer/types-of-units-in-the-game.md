# Types of Units in the Game

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


This section will cover the basic types of units found in the game and describe what they can do\. As we develop more DLCs there is the potential for new kinds of platforms to be introduced into the game\.

## Air Platforms

This covers everything from Aircraft and Helicopters to Drones \(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\-UAV\)\.

### Aircraft

Fighters are various single and multi\-engine aircraft used in CAS and SEAD missions\. Those are missions where bombs, guns, rockets, or Precision Guided Munitions \(PGMs\) are fired or dropped on enemy ground targets\. They appear on the map when they execute a strike mission\. Strikes are ordered very similarly to artillery missions\. When the aircraft arrives and execute its strike, they are vulnerable to enemy air superiority fighters and AD systems within range of the strike target\.

### Drones

Unmanned aerial units operate much like helicopters, but typically fly at higher altitudes and have a smaller detection signature\. They may be harder to see, but they don't use as much terrain masking to protect AD systems\. Flight paths don't depend on the terrain\.
!!! note

    __ We currently do not have any drones in the game, but we may add them later\. Drone technology was in its infancy in the 80s, and there were not many systems suited to the battlefield at this time\.


### Helicopters

These are low\-flying, crewed aircraft\. They move much faster than ground units and will plot flight paths that utilize terrain masking to minimize vulnerability to enemy AD fires\. Various helicopter types include recon, attack, and utility types\.

#### Attack Helicopters \(HELO\-AT\)

They are usually armed with autocannons, rockets, and missiles \(both anti\-tank and anti\-air\)\. Usually unarmored, sometimes lightly armored\. These are very lethal to all types of ground targets\. They are vulnerable to anti\-air \(gun and SAM\), autocannons \(from IFVs  **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.
