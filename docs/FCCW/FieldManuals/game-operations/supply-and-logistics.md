# Supply and Logistics

Supply is the Achilles heel of all modern armies\. It is burned at a ferocious pace during operations and commanding officers are constantly mindful of ‘topping off’ their units\. Given the basic scale and duration of the game, ammunition is likely to be far more of a limiting factor than fuel, rations, or other forms of supply\. 

The lesson of the 1973 Arab\-Israeli war was that ammo gets used up far faster than expected; rates of 5 times greater than expected were not unheard of\. It is an integral part of the command dilemma to be able to ration it out effectively\.

In game terms, resupply is presumed to occur whenever a unit receives Resupply orders and there is a lull in the action, and the supply trucks and other vehicles can come forward and provide ammo and fuel to combat vehicles in place\. Alternatively, individual vehicles drive a short distance to the rear to resupply and then return to their original location\. 

As stated earlier, for a unit to resupply, it must be clear of enemy units and combat\. Units within the command radius of their HQ can get fully resupplied on ammo and gain more readiness and morale recovery\. Units outside of the command radius get a small percentage of ammo replacement and gain a minor improvement in readiness and morale\.

## Ammo Loadouts

One of the new features of the game is tracking ammunition down to a single round and by type for most weapon systems\.

Where this new system is utilized is with gun systems that use different munitions and rocket pods\. In the future other weapons will be converted over to having munition options as required\.

Ammo loadouts are set by the scenario design for each unit and during combat those munitions are used per subunit based on the combat situation and available rounds\.

The ammunition available for a unit and its subunits are noted in several places\. It can be seen in the Subunits Panel of the Dashboard for each subunit and on the Ammunition tab in the Personnel and Logistic Report for the entire unit\. See the images below\. 

For indirect fire units, the Fire Support Report Assets tab also notes the total load of munitions for the units\.

More information is shown in the Ammunition report, it shows the number of rounds expended up to that current time in the battle\.

## Resupply

When units are issued a resupply order \(see Section 21\.2 above\) ammunition levels for all weapons are placed back to full based on the scenario designer loadout levels\.

## Automatic Emergency Resupply

If this is selected in Game Options, then any unit that runs out of ammunition is automatically restored to 30% ammo if it falls below 5%\. Unit orders do not affect emergency resupply, and the unit may be moving or fighting at the time\. This option may help new players\.

## Why No Fuel Tracking?

Given the short time and relatively short distances covered in the game, we assume there is enough fuel for the operation on the map to take place\. When units perform a resupply for ammunition and to recover readiness and morale, we assume fuel tanks are topped off as well\. In the future, we may take a more detailed approach to fuel tracking, but for now, it sits beyond trackable concern compared to the other factors we do cover\.
