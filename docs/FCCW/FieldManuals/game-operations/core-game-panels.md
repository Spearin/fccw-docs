To the right of that, there is an icon for wind direction and wind speed\. Next is the percentage of illumination \(which is vital at night based on the phase of the moon\)\. In the upper right, the cloud ceiling in meters is shown \(if one exists\)\. Finally, in the lower right, the next phase in the time\-of\-day cycle \(dusk in this case\)\.
