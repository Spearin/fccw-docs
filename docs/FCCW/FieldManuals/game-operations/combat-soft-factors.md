# Combat Soft Factors

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


One of the key factors that impact combat operations is those things known as Combat Soft factors\. These are the soft data items that represent the human elements found on the battlefield\. The three key elements used in the game are Readiness, Morale, and Training\. 

## Readiness

Readiness is a number from 1 to 99 \(best\) representing the ability of the unit to perform as required\. Readiness is lost during combat and movement actions\. Readiness is recovered when a unit sits in place without being fired on or if it resupplies\. The rate of recovery per hour for the unit is shown\. If a unit’s readiness goes critically low, it will be noted in the Staff Alerts\.

## Morale

Morale is a number from 1 to 99 \(best\) representing the mental state of the unit\. Morale is lost in combat by taking losses or being close to friendly units that take losses\. Morale is recovered slowly by resting and resupply and occasionally by obtaining kills against other units\. If a unit’s Morale goes critically low, it will be noted in the Staff Alerts\. 

## Training

An identifier representing the average amount of prewar training received\. These training levels range between Untrained, Green, Average, Veteran, and Elite\. The higher the unit’s level of training, the more likely it is to perform better on the battlefield, suffer less readiness and morale reduction from events, and recover faster from those losses\. This training level is noted before the primary type of unit in many detailed information displays like the Spotlight Panel\.
