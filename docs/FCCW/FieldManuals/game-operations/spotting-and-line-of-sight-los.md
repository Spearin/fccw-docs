# Spotting and Line of Sight \(LOS\)

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


The ability to detect, that is distinguish between a military platform and its surroundings is heavily impacted by illumination, especially when not equipped with excellent Thermal Imaging or Night Vision equipment\.

So, the gameplay panel gives you weather conditions and weather/meteorological visibility\. The rings indicate this unit's ability to detect military units\.

Spotting requires that the spotting unit have a clear Line of Sight \(LOS\) to the target and that the target be visible to the spotter at that range\. Having a clear LOS to spot a target is required to shoot at it\. 

It is possible only to see a small number of subunits in a unit depending on the cover and concealment value of the hex that the enemy is in and if there are other factors like movement, smoke, or weather effects\.

## Spotting Units

A unit has a maximum spotting range within which it can potentially see any enemy unit\. This will generally equal the maximum visible range for the time of day and weather except when: 

- The unit is firing or moving \- its attention is presumed to be at least partly concentrated on that task and unit sighting is slightly reduced\. 
- The unit posture is Very Exposed; it is presumed to be feeling unthreatened and is not particularly attuned to its surroundings\. The unit sighting range is slightly reduced\. 

Spotting is evaluated after every move, change of posture, burst of fire, and type of sensor capable of spotting enemy units\. Spotting range is a function of weather, visibility range, posture, orders, readiness, currently moving, currently firing, special equipment like ground radar and thermal imaging, smoke, terrain, elevation, observation height, etc\. Each sensor and means of spotting are checked versus each possible subunit meeting both the range of spotting and spottable range distance\.

Units also have an individual “spottable range”\. The spottable range is a function of unit posture, size, terrain, currently moving, currently firing, etc\. Enemy units beyond this range cannot spot them unless special sensors are involved\.

For example, a small non\-firing infantry unit on a hilltop can see a long way but can be spotted from only a very short distance\. 

The current spotting and spottable ranges for each unit can be viewed by selecting the Show LOS \(Ctrl\-L\) or Show Spottable From \(Ctrl\-O\) function on the orders menu\. Spotting states: 

- __Undetected__ – the unit counter is not revealed to the enemy in any way\. There will be no indication that it is in a particular location at all\. 
- __Detected__ – The contact may be as imprecise as a rising cloud of dust or a fleeting glimpse of unknown vehicles between some trees or buildings\. The unit counter with nationality and question mark \(?\) but no other details will be revealed\. This contact is not strong enough to count as a spotted target for artillery or other types of combat\. The unit is not browsable in this state and does not show up in the tally of enemy runners\. If Automatic Spotting is enabled, then all enemy units will be shown in this state at the minimum\. 
- __Classified__ – The unit type has been revealed with a fair degree of accuracy\. Some counter details are shown\. An example of a Classified unit would be a tank company, an artillery unit that has fired and given away its location, an HQ that has been too busy on the radio, or a unit that has been previously spotted and has not yet moved away\. 
- __Identified__ – The unit is close enough and has been seen long enough to determine the exact types of subunits in the enemy unit and most of the unit counter information is shown\. 

All headquarters and artillery units are deemed to automatically spot every enemy unit spotted by any friendly unit via radio communication and that allows the Staff FSCC to direct fires at known targets\.

Units that disappear from LOS may become “lost” and need to be reacquired to be identified again\.

## Line of Sight \(LOS\) 

Due to a combination of elevation and terrain considerations the potential exists to have sweeping vistas in some directions and to be all but blind in others\.

A view from one hex to another is considered blocked if there is an intervening elevation or if the accumulated visual clutter due to cover, wrecks, and smoke along the LOS drops the visibility below 10% for most units\.

LOS is checked in two steps: 

First, there is a hard check of elevations between each spotter and each subunit in the target unit\. If a line from one hex to the other is broken by an elevation at or above the line at the location the LOS is blocked\. 

If the first check passes, the second test is to see if the accumulated visual hindrance from the terrain, smoke, wreck, etc\. falls below 10% and is considered blocked\. 

Recon units and units with thermal sights have a bonus that improves their ability to see deeper into terrain or through smoke\.

## Time of Day and Weather Impact

Visibility during the night is the same as during the day and is determined by the dust and water particles in the air\.

On a clear night, you can see as far as the moon allows, and you might see distant flashes from guns firing\. We cap visibility at 10km for Western Europe via the weather data\.

Illumination at night is low \(between 0% with no moon to 40% at full moon\) vs 100% during the day and an in\-between value during the dawn and dusk transitions\. Even though the visual range may be several thousand meters at night, the visual spotting range is a function of the night illumination level\. Without thermal or other means of illumination, optical spotting at 0% illumination is not possible\.

For more information on Time of Day see Section 28 below\. For more details about the types of Weather in the game, see Section 29 below\.
