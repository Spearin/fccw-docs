# Victory Conditions and End Game

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


The victory conditions for each player are specified in detail in the mission briefings\. The most important way to ensure victory is to find and secure the victory point \(VP\) locations that have been placed on the map by the scenario designer\. Blue locations are secured by Player 1, red locations by Player 2, and yellow locations have not been secured yet by either\. An unsecured location becomes “secured” if a friendly ground unit passes through it\. Air units like helicopters can fly over this location and engage or spot enemy units, but they cannot “take” an objective\. The values of the different locations are shown in the map marker and the Scenario Information Staff Report\.

Players also get victory points for knocking out or destroying enemy subunits\. The value of each subunit is shown in the Subunit Inspector\. The exact number of VP points is awarded whether the subunit is destroyed or just minimally damaged – either way, it is a mission kill and that is what is being measured\.

## Game End and Mission Post\-Mortem

The game is over when the end of the scenario time limit is reached or when the force strength of one side or the other drops below 30% and triggers “Sudden Death”\. The length of the game in hours is defined in the mission briefing\. Force strength is the percentage of active unit’s VPs over the total number of force VPs \(so it starts at 100% and goes down as you accrue losses\) for each side\. 

Once one of these end\-game triggers is reached the Battle Over screen seen below is displayed and there is somber end\-game theme music to listen to as you review the mission postmortem\. 

A representative of the General Staff Inspectorate provides a quick review of your combat actions/combat decisions\. This person holds your fate in his hands and is also harried, short of sleep, and unlikely to take a finely balanced view of the nuances of your performance\. The general will quickly evaluate your performance, telling you if you did an excellent job, you failed your mission, or something in between\. This will be based on your victory points\. Next, a Star Rating is shown with the filled stars indicating a basic “X” out of seven \(7\) rating for the mission\. Next, the percentage of VPs awarded is noted and a listing of enemy subunits you claimed will be shown\. Finally, the general will tell you in what shape your force is based on losses and fallouts and an estimation of recovery time to get back up to full combat strength\. 

Click the Proceed button to continue to the Scenario Information Report to see the Post\-Mortem results\.

## Final Report

The Final Report \(see below\) is a repeat of the Battle Over screen and allows you to see that information again as well as note which Battle Plans each side used if it was under AI control\.

## Butcher’s Bill

The Butcher Bill is a tally of all the units lost \(Destroyed or Fallen Out\) during the battle\. The information is displayed in several forms and compares your forces to those of your enemy\.

Section A of the Butcher’s Bill has a graph showing the breakdown of subunits for both sides with the long faint bar showing the number of starting units of that type and the short darker bar showing units remaining of the type\. Starting and ending numbers are also listed with each row\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Sections B and C show the state of your forces by Unit Type and by Platform respectively in a tabled format\. 

Section B looks at each general Type of subunit, how many Started the scenario, how many are still Running at the end of the scenario, any subunits that have Withdrawn, the number of subunits Fallen Out \(Damaged/Wounded\), and finally the number of subunits Destroyed \(Destroyed/Killed in Action\)\. The final Totals for each column are shown at the bottom of the table\.

Section C looks at each type of Platform in the battle, a Description of that platform, how many Started the scenario, how many are still Running at the end of the scenario, any platforms that have Withdrawn, the number of platforms Fallen Out \(Damaged/Wounded\), and finally the number of platforms Destroyed \(Destroyed/Killed in Action\)\. The final Totals for each column are shown at the bottom of the table\.

Sections D and E show the state of the Enemy forces by Unit Type and by Platform respectively\. The information is in the same format as noted above for Sections B and C\.

## Victory Status and Conditions

Section A provides a graphical and tabled representation of the final Victory Point Distribution and game result\. 

The colored bar at the top shows via the white bars where your score landed, and then some text noting the percentage of VPs gained and the result of the battle\.

Next is a table showing the breakdown of starting forces and VPs awarded for both sides in the scenario that reaches the final VP distribution total\. 

Section A\.1 shows the colored bar and the distributed VP values that match up to the various victory conditions for your force\. These percentages are based on the starting VP conditions for the scenario and allow for unbalanced forces in a scenario but provide real victory conditions based on these ratios\. Lastly, the Catastrophic Force Loss Threshold triggers Sudden Death\.

Section B provides a table of VP location ownership by side and contested and neutral \(not owned\) locations\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Section C provides details on how ownership of the VP location was determined based on local units and time remaining in the game\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



## Sudden Death

Once a side has triggered “Sudden Death” by having their forces drop below the indicated Catastrophic Force Loss Threshold, the outcome of the scenario will be a foregone conclusion\. By the time a force has been eroded down to 30% of its starting value, it has become combat ineffective in the grand scheme of the battle and is assumed to pull back remaining forces to be available in the future\. 

There is the option to continue playing until the end of the scenario time or until the point you wish to end the game via the menu\. 

__NOTE__: It is infrequent to improve on the Sudden Death evaluation as your forces are combat ineffective and usually will suffer more losses if the Sudden Death point is ignored\.
