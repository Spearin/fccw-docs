# Weather

Weather plays an important role and has a significant influence on visibility and can also impact the performance of certain weapons and sensors\. The Weather in the game is dynamic and based on real\-world weather data\. A weather forecast is available in the Intelligence Staff Reports and you should review it to know when and for how long the weather may change\. The following sections will give a summary of the available weather types currently in the game\.

During the game when the weather changes, a popup dialog will show with the relevant information for the change\.

## Clear

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

Clear weather means no precipitation and little to no clouds with extended visibility ranges based on the time of day, moon phase at night, and cloud cover\. Clear weather has no adverse impact on weapons or sensors\. At night the moon symbol is shown\.

## Cloudy

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

Cloudy weather means a mix of sun and clouds with no precipitation and suitable visibility ranges for all methods of spotting\. Cloudy weather may have an impact on close air support operations if the cloud deck is too low\. At night the sun is replaced with a moon symbol\.

## Overcast

Overcast weather means a blanket of clouds with no precipitation and very little to no sunshine\. Overcast conditions still have reasonable visibility ranges for all methods of spotting\. Overcast weather may have an impact on close air support operations if the cloud deck is too low\.> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



## Light Rain

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

Light rain is scattered showers with minimal impact on visibility, weapons, and sensors\. Visibility ranges will still be decent in these conditions\. This type of weather does not impact the effectiveness of your fighting forces\.

## Moderate Rain

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

Moderate Rain is a constant widespread rain that has a moderate impact on visibility\. Moderate rain may impact the accuracy of some optically guided weapons and degrade the range of detection for thermal imaging sensors\. This type of weather does have some adverse effects on your fighting forces and may halt air operations\.

## Heavy Rain

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

Heavy Rain is a constant heavy downpour that impacts visibility\. Heavy rain will impact the accuracy of some optically guided weapons and degrade the range of detection for thermal imaging sensors\. It is essential to take these factors into account when the weather is abysmal on the battlefield\. Heavy rain can stop air operations for specific aircraft\.

Snow

Even though the game is set in the spring/summer of 1989, you can make scenarios in the fall and winter, and in the case of winter, snow can be a condition\. Snow impacts vision has an impact on weapons and sensors and can also impact aircraft and helicopter operations\.

## Fog / Mist / Haze

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

Fog/Mist/Haze sits low to the ground dramatically reduces visibility ranges and impacts thermal sights and other sensors and weapons when present\. Fog or mist has a better chance of occurring at night and dawn\. It will burn off within a few hours after sunrise\. Fog/Mist/Haze can occur in Clear, Cloudy, or Overcast weather states\.

## Weather and Movement

While weather does impact operations, weapons, and sensors in the game engine, there are currently no impacts on ground movement based on terrain and weather\. The Development Team does want to address this in a future update so seasons and weather change movement rates\.
