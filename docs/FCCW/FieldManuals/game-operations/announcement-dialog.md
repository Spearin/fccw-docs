# Announcement Dialog

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


When a scenario first starts, there is a dialog that pops up in the center of the screen with basic information about the scenario\. It gives you the Commander’s name, the side played, and then a few links to Staff Reports that you can bring up and review \(see Section 15 below for details on those reports\)\. 

The dialog also tells you that you can set up your forces on the map and tells you a general breakdown of those forces\. As noted in the dialog, I wish you the best of luck with the upcoming battle\.
