## General Tab

The General Tab allows the player to Customize basic game engine performance parameters, set Weather Unit Preferences and set the Display Rank and Abbreviation languages\.

### Customize

- __Default Game Delay Factor__ \- This value controls the pacing of the game during turn resolution\. If you find that the resolution is happening too quickly to follow, then use a larger number\. If it is too slow, then use a smaller number\.
- __Map Mouse Hover Delay \- __The length of time needed to trigger the map flyover panel showing the objects in the hex\.
- __Hex Location Flashes –__ Set the number of times the hex of an active unit flashes to alert the player\.
- __Default Animation Speed__ – Sets how fast the in\-game animations are shown during combat resolution\.
- __Show Detailed Unit Composition__ \- If checked and when known various in\-game displays will show the actual platform names \(“T\-72M”\) in the description window instead of generic descriptions \(“Tank”\)\.
- __Close the ‘Secure Transmission’ message dialog__ __on a timer__ – If this option is checked, dialogs use a timer \(displayed in the dialog box\) to close\. If not enabled, then the Secure Transmission dialogs will remain on screen until the user clears them by selecting the Proceed button\.
- __Mouse wheel rolled forward zooms map out __– If checked, scrolling the mouse wheel forward will zoom the map out to see more of it\. Scrolling backward will zoom the map in\. The zoom IS NOT centered on the cursor\. Unchecking will flip the direction of the zooming\.
- __Show Barrage Editor after creating artillery TRP\(s\) __– If checked, after the player plots any Artillery Target Reference Points \(TRPs\), the Barrage Editor dialog will automatically open so adjustments to the fire missions can be made\.

### Weather Unit Preferences

These settings change how information is displayed throughout the game\.

- __Temperature__ – You can set this to either Fahrenheit \(degrees F\) or Celsius \(degrees C\)\.
- __Range __– Distances can be referred to in Meters \(m\) or Miles \(mi\)\.
- __Wind Speed__ – Speeds can be in Kilometers Per Hour \(km/h\), Miles Per Hour \(mph\), or Beaufort Wind Force Scale \(Bft\)\.
- __Cloud Ceiling __– The cloud ceiling can be shown in Meters \(m\) or Feet \(f\)\.

### Display Rank Information

You can choose to see ranks in the American \(US Army\) rank names or in the National language of the country\.

## Scrolling and Sound Tab

The player can alter different values regarding Map Scrolling Parameters and Sound Volumes on this customization tab\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



### Map Scrolling Parameters

- __Map Edge or Game Edge \- __The map is scrolled by hovering the mouse cursor in a sensitive zone of the game\. This zone can either run along the inside edge of the map or the inside edge of the entire game \(program\) screen\. Be aware that if you choose the game edge, then there may be unwanted scrolling when trying to access specific information controls\. This effect may be more pronounced on multiple monitors or extremely widescreen displays\.
- __Effective Border Areas__ \- Define the top, bottom, and sides of the sensitive area independently of each other\. The value is the number of screen pixels of the sensitive zone for scrolling\.
- __Polling Interval__ \- This is the length of time between checks for a map scroll measured in thousandths of a second\. The polling interval defines one ‘tick\.’ 
- __Initial Delay Factor__ \- This is the number of ticks before a scrolling action is initiated\. A certain delay may be desirable to prevent unwanted scrolling when moving through these zones to other areas of the screen\. 
- __Scroll Increment__ \- is the number of pixels that are scrolled for each tick\. Use a lower value for faster/smoother scrolling\.

### Sound Volumes

- __Check Box__ – This check box turns off all sounds without changing the settings below it when sounds are required\.
- __Unit Sound FX__ \- This is the volume control for unit movement and firing sounds\.
- __Background FX \- __This controls the volume of the ambient background battle noise during turn resolution\.
- __Intro Music __\- Controls the volume of the beginning and endgame music themes\.

## Turn Resolution Tab

Here, you can tweak various settings that influence how the turn resolution is displayed \(these are not rule changes\)\. Should you wish to speed up the progress, you can disable some settings here\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



### Combat Resolution

- __Scroll Map to On\-Map Firing Artillery Units during Turn Resolution__ – When checked, the game will scroll to the firing on\-map indirect fire unit and then the target\. Disable to speed up the resolution of combat\.
- __Show Line of Fire \(LOF\) from Attacked to Defender__ \- If checked, a line is drawn on the map from the attacker to the target to show the current direct fire attack being resolved\.
- In some cases, the attacker may not be spotted, but the general area of fire may be noticed\. 
- __Flash Target Hex Location__ \- When checked, the hex of the target unit in combat will flash the number of times set in the General tab to help locate the action\.
- __Enable Combat Sound Effects –__ When checked, a few of the current weapon shooting/launching sound effects will play\. Disable to speed up combat resolution\.
- __Enable “Hit” Animations__ – When checked, attacks on units that hit will cause an explosion\(s\) graphic on the counter\. Disable to speed up combat resolution some\. 
- __Show Combat Result Hints \-__ If this item is checked, the results of combat actions will be displayed as hints next to the affected unit\. Here, you can also alter the Combat Hint Font Size: The size of the combat hints displayed during the game can be increased or decreased by changing the value\. 

### Additional Settings

- __Autosave game after each player orders phase \- __When checked, this will save the game immediately before turning resolution into the \\Saved folder under the name of the scenario and with a percentage complete number\. These are regular saved games and maybe reopened and resumed if desired\.__ __
- __Show friendly movement paths during turn resolution__ – When checked, all friendly units with plotted movement show those moves on the map with plot lines\. Disable to speed up combat resolution a bit\. 
- __Enable Unit Movement Sound Effects__ – When checked, the game plays various types of movement sound effects like tracks, wheels, rotors, etc\. Disable to speed up combat resolution a bit\. 
- __Scroll Map to Active Unit during Turn Resolution__ \- When checked, the map will center on the active unit during turn resolution\. 

## Game Colors Tab

A color selection dialog exists so that individual map overlays, fire lines, and other helpful color markers can be edited by the player and established as new game defaults\. > **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



The level of color transparency can also be changed\. This will allow the player, for example, to create a distinctly different hue for each kind of overlay so that he can easily tell which is in effect at any given time\. The effect of these changes can be seen in the terrain sample to the right of the selections\.

__Reset to Defaults \- __This__ __button will return all color options back to the game’s default settings for color size and transparency\.
!!! note

    __ It is possible to create unsightly or even invisible colors\. If you want to experiment with this, you might want to consider backing up the original “overlays\.ini” file\.
