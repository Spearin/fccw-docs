## Scenario Selection Dialog

This will launch the Scenario Selection dialog, as seen below\. In the list, you can review all the scenarios that are available in the module\. Selecting a scenario by clicking on it will also show a description of the scenario’s meta\-data details\. The details state the map and forces used \(nation and the number of units\) in the selected scenario\. Lastly, you can read the Scenario Summary to get an idea of the mission and historical context of the battle\.

### Selection Criteria

To the right of the Scenario Selection List is a Selection Criteria panel where you can search for a scenario by entering names or other scenario details in the text box\. 

Below the Text box for Criteria Search are flags of all the nations in the current module\. Clicking on one will filter the scenario list to include only that nation\.

There is also the option to filter the scenario selection list by the size of the scenario based on total units\. You can check any or all boxes to set the list \(filtered or otherwise\) to show only scenarios of the given size\(s\)\. 

### Select a Scenario

Click on a scenario name to show the information and select it to play\.

## Play Mode Selections

When you start a new scenario, the next thing to do is to decide how the game will be played and what side, if any, you will play as the player\.

### Style of Play

Currently, the game system offers four styles of play for you to choose from\. 

- __Computer Opponent \- __Play against our AI using either a random or set Battle Plan \(See Section 4\.3 below\)\.
- __Head\-to\-Head Play \(Hot Seat\) \- __Play against another human on the same computer in hot seat mode, taking turns issuing orders and then watching the resolution phase together\.
- __Start a Play by Email Game \(Classic PBEM\) __– Load up a scenario to play against another human using the classic Play by Email \(PBEM\) system, where you send the game file to your opponent via email or, these days, a cloud service\. See Section 7 below for more details\.
- __Computer Plays Both Sides__ – The computer AI plays both sides and uses a Battle Plan, if set, to fight out the scenario\. 

### Which Commander will you be

This selection will determine which side you will command in a human\-played game mode\.

- __Player 1: NATO Commander – __You will play, for example, as an American, Canadian, French, or West German commander\.
- __Player 2: Warsaw Pact Commander – __You will play, for example, as a Czechoslovakian, East\-German, or Soviet commander\.

## Battle Planning Options

At the bottom of the Start, a Scenario Screen is the option to set the AI Battle Plan or have it randomly determined to add to the unknown nature of the enemy’s locations and routes of travel at the start of the scenario\. Some scenarios may not have a Battle Plan, and the selection box will be greyed out\. 

Additional Battleplans can be added to scenarios to increase the replayability of a given scenario further\.

Hit the Proceed button to move on to the Difficulty Settings dialog\.

## Difficulty Settings

While most games have difficulty settings that make the game easier to win by raising and lowering various values, our game does not do that\. There are a few adjustments you can make to make things easier to learn the game, and in that way, the game is “easier” to play, but not necessarily easier to win\. No gameplay values are modified, so if tank A shoots and can kill tank B, this will always be the case regardless of these settings\.

### Presets

There are three presets to set the various difficulty options\. The Custom option will be set if you make your settings\. These are saved and active on reloading\.

- __Recruit__ \- Set this if you are new to the game system to turn on all the options to make learning the game easier\.
- __Veteran__ \- Set this if you are familiar with our game system and want more of a challenge\.
- __Grognard __\- The ultimate in realism\. No options are set\. Good hunting\!
- __Custom__ \- You can set your options to play the game the way you want\. 

### Game Options for the Players

There are three settings that you can adjust for each side of the game\. These will change how you see various information in the game\. Checked options will make gameplay easier for the player\.

- __Enemy Units are Always Visible__ – When checked, this is the most potent option, as you will always see all the enemies on the map\. Combat still requires the units to “see” the enemy, but you do not need to locate hidden enemies by recon or fire\. When unchecked, units will have to use their sensors to spot enemy units and take time to identify them before they will be displayed on the game map\. __NOTE:__ If checked units that are spotted will have a white spotting dot on the lower right of the counter\. These dots will not be shown if unchecked\.
- __Emergency Resupply is Automatic__ – When checked, this setting allows units with low ammo to resupply an amount of ammo to keep fighting automatically\. When unchecked, you, as the commander, must order units to resupply or set resupply parameters\.
- __Allow Gathering of Full Information of Visible Enemy Units__ – When checked, the player can get more detailed information on a unit by double\-clicking and seeing a Read\-Only version of the enemy unit’s Dashboard\. It is also possible to right\-click and see several of the overlays from the Show menu item\. __NOTE:__ Experienced players should unselect this option for the enemy as it gives away too much information on the enemy and its units\.

### Fog of War for Map Markers

- __See “Unspotted” Victory Point \(VP\) Objectives Accurately__ – When checked, this setting provides perfect information on the markers\. So, if a hostile unit seizes a VP, that information appears immediately on the map\. When unchecked, the map won't reveal hostile triggered VP ownership changes until your units have line\-of\-sight to them\. Friendly triggered changes are visible\.
- __See “Unspotted” Terrain Markers Accurately__ \- When checked, this setting provides perfect information on the markers\. 

So, if a hostile unit builds a bridge, that information appears immediately on the map\. When unchecked, the map won't reveal hostile triggered marker changes \(like bridges or obstacles\) until your units have line\-of\-sight to them\. Friendly triggered changes are visible\.

### Proceed to Scenario

Hit Proceed to load the selected scenario\.
