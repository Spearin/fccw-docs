For any selected unit or units \(Alt, Ctrl, or Shift selected\), the setting will be applied to those units shown as checked in the setting dialog that pops up after choosing a setting\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



- __Acceptable Losses\.\.\.__ – This is the unit\(s\) willingness to take losses before seeking a change in orders\. This works with the Tactical Initiative above to set how a unit reacts\. The settings for this item are Do or Die, Substantial, Moderate, or Minimal\.__ __
- __Preferred Standoff Range\.\.\.__ – The number of 500m hexes you wish the unit\(s\) to be distant from any detected enemy units\.
- __Fire Discipline\.\.\.__ – This sets the range or ability to shoot at enemy units in direct fire\. The available settings are Refuse fire, Hold until fired on, Point blank \(0 to 1 hex\), Short Range \(1/3 Max Range\), Medium Range \(2/3 Max Range\), and Maximum Range\. __NOTE:__ This applies to all the unit’s weapons\.
- __Minefield Contact\.\.\.__ – This is the unit\(s\) response to entering a minefield\. The options here are Ignore and Run \(do not delay and accept the potential for more subunit losses crossing the field\), In Stride Breach \(units slow down to follow a leader through the field, hoping to avoid mines by traveling in the same tracks\), or Stop and Reduce \(units halt and either wait for engineers to remove enough mines to open a path through or do the work themselves at a slower rate\)\.__ __
- __Relocate When\.\.\.__ – This determines under what condition a unit will seek to scoot to a new location for better protection or to avoid enemy fire\.

The possible selections are After each fire mission, After all fire missions, While the enemy spotted, After receiving any fire, After receiving direct fire, After taking any losses, After taking direct fire losses, or Never\. Some of these settings work better for certain types of units\. The after\-fire mission settings work better for artillery, for instance\.

- __Movement Preferences\.\.\.__  – When a unit moves from waypoint to waypoint, there are a few options for how that travel can be done\. The hasty move will prefer roads, and Deliberate or Assaulting move orders will mix roads with cross\-country movement\. You can set stricter movement preferences by checking the boxes for Concealment \(more off\-road and seeking better\-covered terrain to move through, Roads \(favor taking roads instead of cross country\), and Avoid NBC \(which will path units around NBC\-contaminated locations on the map\)\.
- __Passengers Disembark\.\.\.__ – Selecting this option will display the Adjust SOP options sub\-menu\. See Section 11\.5\.1 above for details on the various color options\.__ __
- __Carriers, when Empty\.\.\.__ – Selecting this option will display the Set SOP options sub\-menu\. See Section 11\.5\.1 above for details on the various color options\.
- __Direct Support Priority to\.\.\.__ – Selecting this action will open the SOP Manager Dialog for the selected unit\.  See Section 23 below for details on the setting of this dialog\.

Once an SOP Adjustment is selected, the following confirmation dialog is shown that states the SOP settings adjusted for the selected units\. Under each counter is a checkbox that allows you to select which of a group of units the SOP Adjustments apply to\. At the bottom, there are options to apply the new SOP Adjustment to the current default order, all movement orders, and all non\-movement orders\. The recycle button allows you to quickly invert the selected unit checkboxes in the dialog\. When you are ready to apply hit the Done button\. If you change your mind and do not want to do any SOP Adjustment, click the cancel button\.

### Map Zoom Options

The Zoom Options menu item provides the user with the ability to zoom the map from 30% up to 200%\. This wide range allows layers on very high\-resolution screens to zoom in and still see and read counters and the map\. The Fit option automatically scales the entire map to fit on the screen\. There are hotkeys for the basic ranges between 50% and 130%\.
