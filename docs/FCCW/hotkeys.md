# Hotkey Use in Flashpoint Campaigns

As with most software, Flashpoint Campaigns \- Cold War \(FCCW\) has many predefined Hotkeys that substitute menu functions or speed button clicks to perform various actions in the simulation\.

The following section shows the keys and effects currently supported\. There are a few *Available* keys left in the listing, and new functions may be added in the future\. Hotkeys are also noted in the various menus within the simulation\. 

## About Rebinding Hotkeys

Due to the nature of the code, the colossal number of hotkeys, and how deep all these hotkeys are embedded in many functions and procedures, there is currently no way to rebind keys within the game\.
