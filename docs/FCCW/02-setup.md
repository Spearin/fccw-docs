## Installing the Game

To install the game, insert the game DVD disc into your DVD drive\. If you have disabled the Autorun function on your DVD or if you are installing from a digital download, navigate to the DVD or download file location, double\-click on the installation file, and if it is a zip archive, then double click on the executable \(exe\) file that is shown inside the archive\. The correct file name will typically include the words “SetupRelease”\. Follow all on\-screen prompts to complete the installation\. 

If you have purchased your game from the Steam Store, you can download the game by finding it in your Steam library and then pressing the INSTALL button\.

Any games purchased from the Slitherine or Matrix stores available on Steam can also be registered for a Steam Key, allowing you to add the game to your Steam library\. To do this go to http://www\.matrixgames\.com/my\_page and enter your serial number that came with the download to register\.

## Uninstalling the Game

Please use the Add/Remove Programs or Programs and Features option from the Windows Control Panel or the “Uninstall” link in the game’s Windows START menu to uninstall the game\. Uninstalling through any other method will not correctly uninstall the game\.

## Product Updates

To maintain our product excellence, Matrix Games and Slitherine release updates containing new features, enhancements, and corrections to any known issues\. All our updates are free on our website \(see more details in the section below\) and can also be downloaded quickly and easily by clicking on the Check for Updates link in your Game Launcher\.

## Register Your Game, Re\-Download Your Game, Beta Updates

We also periodically make beta \(preview\) updates and other content available to registered owners\. Keeping up with these special updates is easy and accessible by signing up for a Slitherine Group Member account\. When you are signed up, you can then register your Slitherine Group products to receive access to these game\-related materials\. Doing so is a simple two\-step process:

__Sign Up for a Slitherine Group Member account__ \- THIS IS A ONE TIME PROCEDURE; once you have signed up for an account, you are in the system and will not need to sign up again\. Go to www\.slitherine\.com and click the SIGN UP button on the top\-right, then click “Register” on the subsequent page after filling in your personal information\. When you’re finished a confirmation email will be sent to your specified e\-mail account\.

__Register a New Game Purchase__ \- Once you have signed up for a Slitherine Group Member account, you can register any Slitherine/Matrix title you own in your new account\. To do so, log in to your account on either the Matrix Games website \(www\.matrixgames\.com\) or the Slitherine website \(www\.slitherine\.com\)\. Click MY PAGE on the top and then REGISTER SERIAL on the right to register your new purchase\. 

We strongly recommend registering your game as it will give you a backup location for your serial number should you lose it in the future\. 

__If you have already logged into your main member account when you purchased your game, it will be automatically registered for you as part of the purchase process\.__

Once you’ve registered your game, when you log in to the Members section you can view your list of registered titles by clicking My Page\. Each game title is a hyperlink that will take you to an information page on the game \(including all the latest news on that title\)\. Also on this list is a Downloads hyperlink that takes you to a page with all the latest public and registered downloads, including patches, for that particular title\.

You can also access patches and updates via www\.matrixgames\.com/ member/mypage\. Once there, select the game you wish to check updates for, then check the downloads link\. Certain valuable content and additional downloads will be restricted to Group Members, so signing up there is always worthwhile\.

Remember, once you have signed up for a Member account, you do not have to sign up again at that point you are free to register any product you purchase\.

Thank you and enjoy your game\!

## Unified Login System

Slitherine and Matrix now have a new “Unified Login System”\. This system allows you to access the Slitherine and Matrix Games sites using just one username and password\. 

To merge your accounts so that they work for all Slitherine Group sites, go to \(http://samelogin\.slitherine\.com/\) and enter the details of one of your accounts \(ie\. Either your Matrix or your Slitherine login\)\. 

You will then be presented with the option to merge your accounts \(listed as “\[Merge my accounts\]”\), which will then allow you to combine any other accounts you have or generate a user for another website using the exact details \(For instance, if you were called “JohnSmith123” on the Slitherine site but had no account on Matrix, you could enter the details into the site and it would create a “JohnSmith123” account for Matrix as well, with the same password as the Slitherine login\.\)

## Game Forums

Our forums are one of the best things about Matrix Games\. Every game has its forum with our designers, developers and the gamers playing the game\. If you are experiencing a problem, have a question or just an idea on improving the game, post a message there\. Go to __*http://www\.matrixgames\.com*__ and click on the Forums hyperlink\.

## Technical Support

 Should you have a technical problem with the game, the best way to get help is to post a note in the Technical Support sub\-forum of the main game forum at http://www\.matrixgames\.com/forums\. You’ll then hear back from either our Matrix Games Staff, the development team, or one of the many helpful players of the game\. This method is usually the fastest way to get help\. Alternatively, you can contact our Help Desk at [http://www\.matrixgames\.com/support/](http://www.matrixgames.com/support/) or support@matrixgames\.com\. Support requests will generally be answered within 24 hours, except on weekends or US/UK national holidays\.
