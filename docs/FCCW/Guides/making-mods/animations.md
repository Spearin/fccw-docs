While the game engine is basically 2D, we do have a few animations for various effects to add some action\. 

## Use

These animations are mainly short lived and small in size\. Most of these are related to combat actions like shooting or explosive effects\.

## Location of Assets

Animations are located in /Modules/Common/Animations folder\. These assets are used by the game engine for the type of actions noted by the filename\.

## Size and Format Required

Users cannot add new items to this folder\. If you wish to change the any animation in this folder, you must do the following:

- Use the same name
- The art element must have the same size for height and width in pixels and the same name and number of frames and duration
- The animation frames should be PNG files with transparency
-  The files must be saved into a ZIP file with the same name
!!! note

    __ Making an animation too large or small, too long or short, or misspelling the name of frames or the file can result in a game engine crash\.

!!! note

    __ If you plan to make new animations, it is advised to back up the originals to a new location\.
