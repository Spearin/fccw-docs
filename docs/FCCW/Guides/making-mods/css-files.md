# CSS Files

> **Note**: Images omitted â€” refer to original DOCX for figures.


We have many CSS files in various locations in the game folders that set parameters for several of the dialogs and other elements of the game UI\. We are not going to list them here as they really should not be messed with as it can wreck the UI and cause crashes\. If you are adept at HTML 5 and understand the layout and use of CSS files, you can try to do edits\. 
!!! warning

    __Editing CSS files can crash or mess up the UI and make the game unplayable\. Again, if you want to try it, make backups and be very careful with what you change\.
