# Battle Plans SOPs

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


Standard 0perating Procedures are designed to ensure consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness in executing operations while minimizing risks and maximizing the chances of success on the battlefield\. 

For more details on “Standard Operating Procedures” see “Section 23 __FM01 Game Operations__”\.

## SOP Manager

All SOP changes by the SOP Manager can now be confirmed or canceled\. When pressing Apply in the SOP Manager, or from any other menu, a dialog will be displayed listing the units involved \(in OOB order\) with the ability to conform, cancel, and/or change the selection of units as shown in Figure 49\.

Clicking a counter on the dashboard toggles the selection and highlights that unit’s position on the map\.

The ability to unselect units in the confirmation dialog also allows you to check a group of units selected, and selectively apply changes, instead of having to deselect/reselect units on the map\.

There are two ways to change or apply SOPs: Set SOPs and Adjusted SOPs\.

## Set SOPs

“Set SOP” allows you to apply a SOP Preset to the selected units\. A collection of SOP Presets has been made available from the menu, organized by unit type as shown in Figure 51\.

For this example, we will select A Company 1\-16 INF\. To do that highlight the company headquarters, hold down the “__Ctrl__” key, and then select the company headquarters, it will show the entire company as shown in Figure 16\.

The game will then present a confirmation dialog for the “IFV Ambush”, with a brief description of the key SOP elements being set in italics, and the same selection mechanism as the other SOP confirmation dialogs as shown in Figure 53\.

Select the “__Proceed__” button and the SOP for these units will be updated in the SOP Manager\.

## Adjust SOPs

“Adjust SOP” allows you to apply changes of one SOP element to the selected unit\(s\) as shown in Figure 54\. 

For example, go to the top SOP menu or the Unit menu, “Adjust SOP”, “Relocate When”, and “After Receiving Direct Fire” as shown in Figure 54\.

Fig\. 54

The game will present a confirmation dialog for the Relocate When change, listing all selected units along with their currently active SOP for “Relocate When”\. 

The dialog repeats the SOP change you have chosen in bold as shown in Figure 55\. Select the “__Proceed__” button and the SOP Manager will get an update\.
