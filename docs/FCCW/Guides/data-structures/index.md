Introduction

Welcome to FLASHPOINT CAMPAIGNS: COLD WAR

This is a grand tactical combat simulation on the Cold War battlefield\. As the force Commander, you will plan and then issue orders and Standard Operating Procedures to your battalion, brigade, or regimental forces, shaping the fight by maneuver and your intent\. Your forces will engage the enemy on rendered real\-world map locations\. Each hex is 500m of militarily significant terrain\. Each battle can last 4 to 24 hours of in\-game time\. Your troops will meet their foes any time of day and in any environment\. 

The game engine is based on asynchronous WEGO turns\. This means you will issue orders and then watch a variable amount of time unfold on the battlefield\. Then, issue or adjust orders to react to what has happened as you execute your battle plan\. 

__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__ is a deep simulation of combat operations where your forces are arranged in maneuver units of companies, platoons, and sections of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry squads and teams, recon forces, engineers, air\-defense and anti\-tank systems, helicopters and more\. As the Commander, you must use available off\-map assets like long\-range artillery, rockets, or airstrikes\. 

Your efforts in this complex battlespace will be constantly challenged by modeled features like Electronic Warfare, Air Superiority, Realistic Weather, Line of Sight and Fire, Terrain and Elevation, Smoke and Mines, and Human Factors like training, morale, and readiness\. All these elements must be considered if you are to be victorious on the battlefield\. 

The game is packed with information dialogs, map overlays, and range rings to aid you as Commander, master the situation, and understand your force’s capabilities\.

__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__ is a data\-rich simulation where each nation has information on National Characteristics, Command Parameters, and Orders of Battle\. Data Tables are packed with era\-specific equipment and troops\. Weapon Systems of the time, such as guns, missiles, precision munitions, small arms, and much more, are comprehensively modeled\. 

As a toolkit, you can create your own scenarios and campaigns\. You can also dive deeper and create or modify game data, artwork, and sound effects as you see fit\. All these modding capabilities are supported by detailed documentation\.

## Manuals

We have chosen to go with many living manuals to cover game interface/play, learning the game, basic tactics, Content Creation, and Game Modding for the Cold War game engine\. We also have guides that cover that area of operations\. The affected manuals and guides will be updated as the game is updated, and PDFs of these changes will be included with the new patches\.

### The Field Manuals \(FM\)

These are the core manuals on how to play, create content for, and modify data for the Cold War game engine\. Before jumping into Content Creation, we strongly recommend you review the first three manuals, __Game Operations__, __Battlefield Primer__, and __Tutorial Operations,__ if you are new to this type of game and warfare\. Returning Flashpoint Campaigns players should review __Game Operations__ to get details on new features, as there are many\.

## Gender Pronouns and Inclusion

We understand that users of all genders will play our simulation\. We try to keep language in the game and manuals gender\-neutral, when possible, but sometimes use the pronoun “he” to refer to the user\. This is merely to streamline the writing, not to exclude anyone or note a specific gender\. 

The On Target Simulations team supports the inclusion of all people in the field of wargaming\.
