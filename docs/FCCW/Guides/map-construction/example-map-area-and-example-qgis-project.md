## The Example Map Area: Minden, West\-Germany

As a map example, I've chosen to recreate the area around the Porta Westfalica area, near Minden and Bad Oeyenhausen, the Weser River and the Mittelandkanal, and the former, Cold War, boundary between the West German I Corps and British I Corps in NORTHAG, West\-Germany\.

It is a good example location since it involves considerable elevation, a river, highway and major roads, lakes, industry, and urban areas, covering many of the terrain types supported by the Flashpoint Campaigns game\.

This area also plays a key role in Ralph Peter’s ‘Red Army’ cold war fiction book\.

## The Example Project ‘Minden area\.qgs’

The example QGis project ‘Minden area’ is made available along with this manual\. You can follow this manual closely to create a similar QGis project from scratch\. Alternatively, you can skim this manual while checking the example project\. Or even use the manual and project to create your own map without having to do a lot of set\-up work\.
