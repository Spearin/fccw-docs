# Getting Started

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


Welcome to making content for the game system\. The Scenario Editor, or ScenEdit for short, is a tool to make your scenarios with the supplied data and maps in the game\.

Videos were made by On Target Simulations LTD making Scenarios and are posted at this link: [How to Create a Scenarios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iULAXVVscbY)

To get started, select the “__Scenario__” button in the Edit section of the Main Menu, as illustrated in Figure 1\.

Clicking the “__Scenario__” button will launch the Scenario Editor\. It may take a few minutes for the editor to load up and show you a map \(the first map in the list by name, you can change it later to the one you want to use\), mini\-map, menu bar, and the main Scenario Editor Dialog, as illustrated on Figure 2\. We will use these tools to make a small scenario\.

## Scenario Creation Checklist

It would help if you took a minute and read through the Scenario Creation Checklist on the starting page of the dialog for some critical information on using the editor\.

## Edit Existing Scenario \(Optional\)

There are a few options here to edit existing scenario files via the different buttons, and they are as follows:

- __Load Standalone SCN File__ – This option will open the Scenario Listing for the current module \(Southern Storm for now\)\. The same filters and selection options from playing a game are here\. You can select a scenario to edit with your changes and then save it with a new or altered name or open a new scenario you're working on to alter or complete it\.
- __Load Campaign SCN File__ – This option will open the Campaign Scenario Listing for the current module \(Southern Storm\)\. The same filters and selection options from playing a game are here\. You can then select a scenario to edit with your changes and save it with a new or altered name or open a new scenario you are working on to alter or complete it\.
- __Clear Scn File__ – This button will wipe all the data for the currently selected scenario from the game so you can start fresh\. __NOTE:__ There is no undo from this, so be sure you want to dump everything\.

If you plan on editing an existing scenario, that information is covered in Section 6 below\.

## Scenario Editor Dialog Buttons

At the bottom of the main Scenario Editor dialog are four buttons that stay in place as the pages change\. These buttons have the following functions\.

- __Previous__ – Return to the previous page in the Scenario Editor dialog\.
- __Next__ – Move to the next page of the Scenario Editor dialog\.
- __Save Scenario__ – Opens up the Scenario Save dialog box where you can give the scenario a name or save over your existing scenario build/design\. If you are changing an existing scenario \(someone else's work\), please make a name adjustment or rename to avoid confusion or overwriting game content\.
- __Exit Editor__ – This button exits the Scenario Editor __*WITHOUT*__ saving any information or changes\.

Since starting a new scenario, we must select the “__Next__” button and read Section 4 below\.
