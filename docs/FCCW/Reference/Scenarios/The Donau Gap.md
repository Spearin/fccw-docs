# The Donau Gap

*21 July 1989, 1900hrs, Southeast of Straubing, West Germany - West-German vs Czechoslovakian forces*



Following their successful crossing of the Donau, the Czechoslovakian 2nd Motor Rifle Division again reverted into over-cautious mode and failed to exploit their gains fully. They instead became involved in a battle of attrition against whatever was left of the West German Panzer Grenadier Battalion 111 and of the retreating Panzer Grenadier Battalion 112. This brought their advance to a total halt for most of the day. Now, arriving at the front was the first forward group of the Czechoslovakian 9th Tank Division.  

pOn the NATO side, intelligence was aware of what was fast approaching the area. So much so that the HQ 4th Panzer Grenadier Division had been desperately trying to maneuver whatever they had on reserve to the area. Due to the aerial interdiction, refugees clogging the roads, and communication issues, the reinforcements were arriving in drips and drabs. It was now a race to see which side could first achieve the critical mass to overcome the other. For NATO, this was becoming crucial as there was not a lot preventing the Czechoslovakians from advancing unopposed into Bavaria since they had a crossing across the Donau. 

On the Czechoslovakian side, the 9th Tank Division was moving forward with abandon. It was up to the 2nd Motor Rifle Division to open a path for them to cross the West German lines. It was late afternoon when the Czechoslovakians started pouring out from their Donau crossing. The area was shelled by artillery and air strikes. At the same time as they were advancing under a hail of fire, the forward elements of the Panzer Grenadier Battalion 112 attacked. With night approaching, in the open countryside, southeast of Straubing, a mobile battle was quickly developing.
