# The Ride of the 12th Cuirassiers

X*August 8, 1989, 0800hrs, Colmar, France - French vs Czechoslovakian forces*



Defenses perimeters within West Germany have started breaking down, and Soviet formations have reached the border with France. In several places, they have crossed the Rhine River and have entered onto French soil. Once such penetration occurred not far from the city of Colmar. Lead elements of the 27th Guards Rifle Division have entered the city and have started to set up defensive positions awaiting reinforcement. Â 

4The French Command ordered the 3rd Armored Division to Colmar to clear the city and to block reinforcements from reaching the city. The Soviet 27th Guards Rifle Division is over-extended and weakened due to combat attrition. The French saw an opportunity at Colmar to push the Soviets back towards the Rhine.
