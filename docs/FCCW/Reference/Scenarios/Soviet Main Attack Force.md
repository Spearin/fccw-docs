# Soviet Main Attack Force

Map:  West of Norderfurt

July 24th 1989 - Day 5 @ 0400 hrs

Forces:  U.S. and W.G. vs Soviets



Stung by the escape of the 11th Armored Cavalry and enraged by the American attack on their supply dump, the Soviet High Command decided to clear this sector of all NATO troops. A highly placed NATO spy in the Soviet Command structure managed to tip off his handler that an offensive was being planned near Norderfurt and when that information was confirmed by West German aerial recon then NATO decided to make a stand.



A battalion from the West German 26th Fallschirmjager was ordered to take the hill northwest of Noderfurt and to hold it at all costs until reinforcements arrive.

 

Meanwhile, the 3rd Brigade of the US 3rd Armored Division was being rushed into the area just as the Soviet s offensive began.
