*21 July 1989, 0500hrs, North of Fulda   West German vs Soviet forces*



The invasion of Western Europe has just begun.  Spetsnaz activities across West Germany and France are causing havoc.  The Warsaw Pact was able to make some surprising headway in many areas in Central Europe. 

3The 27th Motor Rife Division (MRD) grabbed some key crossing sites over the Haune and Fulda rivers on the first day.  Today, they are hoping to push the 28th Tank Regiment to the Southwest of BAD HERSFELD to trap  West German forces and to breach the next defense line before it gets fully prepared. 

Meanwhile, the West Germans are adjusting their defense plans and forming a new defensive line West of BAD HERSFELD.  This will be key to holding the Northern flank of V Corps defense in the FULDA region.
