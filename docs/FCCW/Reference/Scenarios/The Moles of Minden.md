# The Moles of Minden

*30 July1989, 0400hrs, Minden, West Germany - East German vs British forces*



The Warsaw Pact's initial main effort was a brutal attack in northern West Germany to breach the Elbe and Weser Rivers where NATO would put up a determined defense.  The goal was to break out into and exploit across the North German Plain.  NATO s initial stiff resistance put the Warsaw Pact behind schedule, and they soon shifted from a broad front attack to one of a concentrated narrow attack to penetrate the NATO like a dagger thrusting at the heart.    The North East German Front intelligence was able to determine where the boundary was between the United Kingdom s 1st Armored Division holding the left of the British 1st Corps and the right flank of the West German 1st Corps held by the West German 1st Panzer Division.  The Warsaw pact s second echelon Army, the 2nd Guards Tank Army struck along this seam and ripped it apart and exploited to the Weser River where it was able to gain a toehold west of the Weser River at Minden. 

The British Army of the Rhine Commander rushed his 2nd Infantry Division forward to seal the gap but could not oust the Pact forces from the city.  However, the British were able to dig in a Territorial Infantry Battalion along the ridge line just south of the city and west of the Weser.  This task fell to the 6th (Volunteer) Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers of the 15th Infantry Brigade.  The men of the 6 RRF dug into the ridgeline deeply and were able to observe any movement by Warsaw Pact forces attempting to move west out of Minden. 

The East German 6th Motor Rifle Division was tasked to hold Minden and find a way to break out so the communist attack could proceed westward once again.  After repeated failed attempts at blasting the Territorials off the ridge by artillery and airstrikes, the 6 MRD commander came to the realization that the determined British would have to be removed in the age-old way: a bitter frontal infantry attack up the ridge.  The 28th Motor Rifle Regiment was handed the honor of doing so.  In the early morning hours, after a preparatory artillery barrage the Motor Schtzen of the 28th moved out in their BTRs and headed up the ridge to their grim task. 

Due to their well dug-in positions, trench lines, and determined defense the men of the 6RRF would go down into the annuals of the history of World War III to be known as  The Moles of Minden.   !
