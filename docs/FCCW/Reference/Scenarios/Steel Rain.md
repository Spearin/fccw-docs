*21 July 1989, 0200hrs, Northeast of Bamberg, West Germany - US and West-German vs Soviet forces*



At the same time that the US 3rd Brigade, 1st Armor Division was assembling a force to check the Soviet 39th Motor Rifle Division forward group, reconnaissance reports emerged that forces belonging to the 39th Motor Rifle Division were bypassing the WG 103rd Panzer Grenadeir Battalion and advancing on a north-south axis towards Bamberg. Tactical aviation and artillery strikes were assigned to deal with this force. 

As the clash in neighboring Knigsfeld evolved, it became apparent to the US 3rd Brigade HQ that the tactical strikes did not provide enough of a deterrent to stop the Soviet force. As the daylight faded, reconnaissance and intelligence from refugees revealed a picture where the Soviet force had absorbed some of the hits, but they also dispersed to the countryside as a way of keeping their integrity and allowing them to continue to push towards Bamberg.  

This also marked the first serious refugee issue facing NATO forces in Southern Germany. As the Soviet forces approached Bamberg, panic ensued. Despite the best endeavors by law enforcement and military forces in Bamberg, the exodus of the town's civilian population added to NATO's woes. For the 3rd Brigade, it meant that it was assisting an evacuation at the same time that was preparing to defend Bamberg. 

The Soviet 39th Motor Rifle Division force did not have these issues. Their issues were very different. Having spent a large portion of the day's march ducking and diving between air strikes and harassing artillery fires, they had to make further detours to avoid several artillery-emplaced minefields. As they approached Bamberg, the Divisional Commander knew that he would have to sacrifice cohesion for speed since it was imperative that they strike whilst the US 3rd Brigade was fighting it out in Knigsfeld. 

For the US 3rd Brigade, matters were more complicated. In the span of a few hours, they found themselves having to fight on two fronts and also having to deal with assisting the evacuation of Bamberg. The Brigade Commander had secured the main approach routes with small detachments, but everyone was quite clear that these would be mere road bumps. The downside to this division of resources was that the force assembled to meet the advancing Soviets did not allow for strong unit integrity and cohesion. TF 7-6 Mechanized, previously engaged in the area, assumed hasty defensive positions to meet this new threat. In support was TF 3-35 Armor with the mission to do the heavy hitting in stopping the fast-approaching Soviets.
