# The Armored Fist

*22 July 1989, 0200hrs, EPegnitz, West Germany - US and West-German vs East-German forces*



UAs the East-German 7th Panzer Division finished off the 102nd Panzer Grenadier Battalion, the remnants of the 1-2 Armored Calvary Regiment in Hof were trying to escape its clutches. The evolving situation posed a considerable number of problems to the US 1st Arm Division. Not only was the 1-2 Armored Calvary Regiment now isolated, but left unchecked, the 7th Panzer Division had an open route to strike at the northern flank of the 10th Panzer Brigade. This could cause a collapse of the front in this area. What was a tactical problem initially was quickly turning into a strategic one. 



Under heavy pressure from the Czechoslovakian forces, the 10th Panzer Brigade had to rely on the 12th Panzer Grenadier Brigade to seal this threat to the north. The 12th Panzer Grenadier Brigade was now being pulled in two different directions, having to support both the forward defense on the east-west axis and now having to stop the East-German 7th Panzer Division on a north-south axis. It was quickly becoming apparent to everyone that this would not work. 



In the 1st Armor Division HQ, pressure for action resulted from concerns not just with the strategic situation but also with the need to rescue the 1-2 Armored Calvary Regiment. Not only that, but a successful attack by the East-Germans could also place the Division s 1st Brigade at risk. The 1st Brigade had been involved in heavy fighting with the Czechoslovakians and was not in a position to suddenly disengage and turn north to face this threat.



With night setting in, there was a small window of opportunity to catch the East-Germans re-grouping from their latest attacks. Exploiting it was a different matter. There was a lack of forces at hand that could drop what they were doing and strike at the East-German spearhead. 



Confirming NATO s worst fears, reconnaissance reports indicated that a forward group of the East-German 7th Panzer Division was already on the move and heading towards the Pegnitz area. This was a blunder, and NATO quickly realized it. Yes, the forward group was striking deep behind NATO lines, but it was heading too fast, too isolated, creating the perfect condition for an ambush. 



Quickly gathering the highly mobile forces in the vicinity, the 3-2 Armored Calvary Regiment and a battle group of the 1st Brigade, together with West-German support, struck at the head of the East-German 7th Panzer Division.
