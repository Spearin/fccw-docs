# Return to Fulda

*29 July 1989, 0400hrs, Fulda   American vs Soviet forces*

NATO s counterattack has begun with a successful attack at Niddia.  From there, the 3rd Armored Division advanced towards Schotten and were able to break through the Soviet line early on 28 July. After securing Lauterbach, the Americans sent an Armored Battalion southeast towards Fulda. The Soviets were not prepared for the counterattack and had little in place to react to this threat.  They were unable to seal the gap, and their forces arrived too late at Schotten.  A BTR Company is defending in Fulda.  They are not ready prepared to stop the Americans.  Luckily for them, the 244th Motor Rifle Regiment was recovering South of Fulda and has been ordered to move North to assist. 0The war is returning to Fulda with a vengeance.
