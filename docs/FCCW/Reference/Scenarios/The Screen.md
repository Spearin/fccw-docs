# The Screen

*20 Jul 1989, 1200hrs, Salzgitter, Germany - British vs Soviet forces*



lAs soon as the first Warsaw Pact soldier crossed into Western Germany, NATO's defence plan kicked into gear. 

The light forces were tasked with screening the initial WP advance and delaying the Pact's spearheads for as long as possible to give NATO's forces time to get into blocking positions. 

In the Salzgitter area, this task was to be performed by the British 1st Queen Dragoon's Guards. They established their initial screening positions and patiently waited for the arrival of the red forces.!
