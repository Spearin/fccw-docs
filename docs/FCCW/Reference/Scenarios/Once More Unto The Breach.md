# Once more unto the breach

*29 July 1989, 1900hrs, Germersheim, West Germany - French vs East-German forces*



After a tactical pause and re-grouping, the East-German lead unit, the 7th Panzer Division, had now seen action against Americans and West Germans. They, had attacked in tandem with the Soviets, had tried to link with the Czechoslovakians, and finally had crossed the Neckar in support of the Soviet 35th Guards Assault Brigade attack. They were now a spent force with very little capability to overcome the French forces opposing them. Unable to continue their advance, they began to prepare defensive positions.  

wAll would change with the thundering deep strike of the Soviet 1st Tank Army. As the Soviets crashed through NATO defenses, striding deep into NATO s rear echelons, the East Germans received marching orders. It was vital to secure the north flank of this advance. One way to achieve this was to threaten further the central German NATO forces. At the same time, this would create additional pressure on the French forces that were facing the 1st Tank Army.  One regiment of the 7th Panzer Division was rebuilt with forces from other regiments. Once again, the 7th Panzer Division moved forward to apply pressure on the NATO forces. 

The French forces in the Karlsruhe area were becoming thinner, but the II Corps was still committed to ensuring that Pact forces could not roll up the flank of the forces defending central Germany. At the same time that the 7th Panzer Division started its short-range attack, which was aimed at controlling the B272 highway, hopefully pinning the French forces in the area, the 5eme Reg de Cuirassiers started their advance towards the B272. The 5eme Reg de Cuirassiers, a unit that in its history had fought across the world, was to test the mettle of the East Germans. The two forces would meet at sunset and engage in one of the fiercest battles the war had seen thus far as the French tried to push the East Germans against the Rhine.
