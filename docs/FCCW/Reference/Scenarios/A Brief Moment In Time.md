# A Brief Moment In Time

*26 July 1989, 0600hrs, Nagold, West Germany - Canadian and West-German vs Soviet forces*



After the costly success at Tbingen, the Soviet 15th Tank Division used the cover of night to move their spearhead west. They were hoping to resume their pace of advance on the next day. The 48th Motorized Rifle Division was partially liberated and would move south of the Neckar. The East-Germans were also advancing and closing on the Neckar, exerting extra pressure, and routing part of the French defenders in the area.  

In the early hours of the morning, the 15th Tank Division's recon outposts reported a mechanized force was advancing east on their route of approach to Nagold. This was the Canadian 4th Mechanized Bde. Initially, they had assembled west of Nagold with the intention of becoming the mobile reserve behind Stuttgart. They had not arrived anywhere near their intended destination when they were ordered to assemble west of Nagold to get ready to attack. As they were assembling their orders became clear. They had been tasked with blunting the edge of the 15th Tank Division and taking back Tbingen. Maximum effort was to be directed to this effort. 

Without air superiority in the area, but very good knowledge from local intelligence sources of the whereabouts and movements of the 15th Tank Division's advance group, the Canadian 4th Mech Bde moved out. The countryside east of Nagold was about to witness a deadly and brief episode of mobile combat.
