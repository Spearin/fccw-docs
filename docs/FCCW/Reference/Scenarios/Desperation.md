*31 July 1989, 1000hrs, Hunfeld   West German vs Soviet forces*

NATO s counter attack continues to be successful and the Soviets are on their heels, getting pushed back across the front.  The focus of operations North of Fulda is on the bridges in Hunfeld and the connection to the B84 heading into East Germany. 

Soviet forces are reeling.  Between being stopped short of Frankfurt and now being pushed East, morale is slipping.  To make matters worse, supply lines throughout the Warsaw Pact are being targeted by NATO air and missile attacks.  This is causing major supply issues for Soviet forces in West Germany.   

Yesterday, the 15th West German Panzer Brigade destroyed the 242nd Motor Rifle Regiment and seized control of the area around Hunfeld.  The Brigade spent the night reorganizing.  The intent had been to launch an attack South towards Fulda in the morning, but the Brigade HQ got attacked in the early evening by some bypassed Soviet forces scrambled this plan.  A Panzer Battalion got new orders around 0900 and has just started moving South from Bad Hersfeld.  Meanwhile, two other Battalions have been waiting for the Soviets to attack. 

The Soviets were getting desperate and needed to reopen the supply line through Hunfeld.  Orders came down for the 20th Motor Rifle Division to attack Eastward and for the 11 Guards Tank Division to push westward.  Fuel shortages delayed the attack by both divisions.  Hunfeld is going to be the scene of another major battle as elements of two Soviet divisions and a West German Brigade are going to collide.
