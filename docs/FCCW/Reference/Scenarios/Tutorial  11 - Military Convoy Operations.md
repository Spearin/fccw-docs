### Accessing the Tutorial:

To begin this tutorial, open the **Help** menu within Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War. Navigate to the **Field Manuals** folder and locate **FM FCCW-03/R5 Tutorial Operations.pdf** file. Follow the instructions in **Section 14** to launch **Tutorial 11: Military Convoy Operations.**d*  **NOTE: Only Playable from Player 1**
### Tutorial Overview:

Military Convoy Operations are essential for sustaining combat operations across extended lines of communication. This tutorial introduces players to the organization, movement, and protection of troop transport convoys moving through potentially hostile or contested territory.

Players will take command of a military convoy responsible for delivering vital infantry reinforcements and mechanized assets to forward positions. The scenario emphasizes route security, time management, escort planning, and threat response. Key considerations include:

- Proper convoy formation and spacing
d- Route planning using terrain analysis and Mobility Corridors and Avenues of Approach (MCOO)
- Use of escort vehicles and reconnaissance elements
J- Anticipating and reacting to ambushes, air threats, and obstacles
X- Ensuring the timely arrival of reinforcements to influence the frontline battle
Convoy operations are inherently vulnerable and require careful synchronization with adjacent combat and support units. This tutorial offers practical experience managing movement control and sustaining operational momentum under pressure.

### Prerequisites:

This tutorial is designed for new and returning players. It is recommended that earlier tutorials be completed to ensure familiarity with unit tasking, movement orders, support asset coordination, and combat fundamentals.
### Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this tutorial, you will understand how to successfully plan, organize, and execute troop transport convoy operations under combat conditions. You will learn to:

**Plan Convoy Routes Using MCOO:**- Utilize terrain analysis tools to identify suitable routes, avoid chokepoints, and minimize exposure. Plan ingress and egress paths that support security and time-sensitive delivery.
**Organize Convoy Formations:**- Structure your convoy to balance speed and protection. Learn how to position key vehicles troop carriers, escorts, and command elements for maximum effectiveness and survivability.
2**Manage Security Escorts and Recon Elements:**- Deploy armored vehicles, reconnaissance teams, or helicopter support to screen and protect the convoy. Learn how to establish movement overwatch and detect threats before engagement.
**React to Enemy Engagements:**- Develop immediate action drills to respond to ambushes, indirect fire, and air attacks. Learn how to preserve convoy integrity while maintaining forward progress toward the objective.
**Deliver Reinforcements on Time:**- Ensure troops and equipment arrive at frontline positions with minimal delay. Reinforcement timing can be decisive, and success depends on maintaining operational tempo and unit readiness.

### Doctrinal Context:

Military convoys serve as lifelines for sustained combat operations, enabling mobility, reinforcement, and resupply. Cold War doctrine emphasized the need for convoy discipline, route security, and deception to protect these vulnerable movements. This tutorial reflects those principles, teaching players how to balance speed, security, and mission accomplishment in dynamic operational environments.
