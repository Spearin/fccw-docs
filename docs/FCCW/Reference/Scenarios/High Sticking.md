# HIGH STICKING

*23 July 1989, 0500hrs, Forchheim, West Germany   Canadian vs Czechoslovakian Forces* 

The Warsaw Pact attack on West Germany has been going well. They have opened some large holes in the NATO defense in many areas. 

The Czechoslovakian focus is a path to the North of Nuremburg. One of the initial keys is the road and rail node of Forchheim. The 2nd Motor Rifle Division (MRD) is heading in that direction to seize the town and the key roads to the West. They are led by elements of two regiments. 

NATO's response to the gaps in their defenses has been the rapid movement of forces forward. The lead elements of the 4th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (CMBG) are enroute East to Forchheim to deny this node to the Warsaw Pact forces. 

dThe weather has been cold and damp. Today looks like it will be a wet one as the two forces collide.
