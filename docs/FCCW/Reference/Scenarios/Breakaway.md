# BREAKAWAY

*08 August 1989, 0800hrs, Tubingen, West Germany   Canadian and French vs Soviet Forces* 

It has been a week since the Warsaw Pact initiated World War III.  The war has been fought in the air, sea, and on land around all corners of the world.  In Europe, the Warsaw Pact has steadily moved westward, but they have not been able to get a significant breakout.   

However, in the early hours of 08 March, the Warsaw Pact was able to break through NATO defenses South of Stuttgart.  The 11th Guards Tank Division is heading along the south bank of the Neckar River.  There are indications that the Army Group is going to employ some airmobile forces to help pave the way forward by capturing bridges or road nodes in the area between Tubingen and Nagold. 

The 4th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (CMBG) is moving into a blocking position Southwest of Stuttgart along the A 81 Autobahn.  They are spread out, with two Infantry Battalions forward, both with armored support.  The Brigade is tasked with stopping (Blocking) the Soviet advance.  The plan is for the Canadians to fix the Soviets in place for counterattacks by a French force.
