# The Battle Of The Nations

*26 Aug 1989, 0800hrs, Soest, Germany - NATO vs Warsaw Pact forces*



hAs the Soviet forces advanced deeper the issue of bypassing pockets of resistance came to the forefront.After being given a bloody nose on their first engagement with the Soviets, the Belgian forces retreated into the evacuated town of Soest. There they would defend not only the town but also the neighbouring army base. Faced with this, the Soviet 10th Guards Tank Division left a regiment to ensure that the Belgians did not escape while the rest of the division continued their relentless advance, bypassing this pocket of resistance. 

The plan was for the Soviet forces to be replaced by a reserve East German division that were trying their best to move at the required pace.As the exchange was about to happen, NATO forces in the area saw an opportunity to cut the feet of the 10th Guards Tank Division whilst at the same time rescuing the Belgians in Soest. 

To achieve this, they put into action an ambitious multi-national operation as the British advanced from the west and the West-Germans attacked from the north. !
