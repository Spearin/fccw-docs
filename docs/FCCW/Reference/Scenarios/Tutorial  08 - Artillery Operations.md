# Tutorial 08   Artillery Operations


### Accessing the Tutorial:

5To launch this tutorial, navigate to the **Help** menu within Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War. Open the **Field Manuals** folder and locate the **FM FCCW-03R5 Tutorial Operations.pdf** file. Follow the instructions outlined in **Section 8** to begin **Tutorial 08: Artillery Operations.**

c(  **NOTE: Only playable as Player 1**
### Tutorial Overview:

CArtillery Operations are critical to modern combined arms warfare. This tutorial introduces the player to the core functions and tactical employment of artillery assets leveraging indirect fire to support maneuver forces, suppress enemy positions, and shape the battlespace with precision and overwhelming firepower.

mIn this scenario, players will assume command of various artillery platforms, including tube artillery (howitzers) and rocket artillery systems, and learn how to integrate these assets with forward observers (FOs), the Fire Support Coordination Center (FSCC), and other tactical units. Artillery fire will be employed for a range of mission types, including:

B- High-Explosive (HE) fires for suppression and destruction
P- Illumination (ILL) rounds to enhance visibility and expose enemy forces
I- Counter-battery fire to locate and destroy enemy artillery units
8- Scatterable mine deployment to deny key terrain
- Awareness of nuclear and chemical delivery systems, which are not used in this tutorial but are part of Cold War-era doctrine
This tutorial focuses on conventional artillery operations, but understanding the full spectrum of fire support capabilities is essential to developing sound tactical judgment.

### Prerequisites:

9This tutorial is designed for new and returning players who have completed earlier tutorials. Familiarity with the user interface, basic unit control, and movement is recommended. Prior exposure to forward observers and support coordination will enhance your ability to execute artillery tasks effectively.

b  **NOTE: This scenario is intentionally challenging and may sometimes feel difficult or impossible. This high difficulty is by design and offers valuable learning opportunities.**
### Learning Objectives:

Upon completion of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Select and prioritize targets based on tactical impact
- Request and coordinate fire missions via the FSCC
- Employ tube and rocket artillery for sustained support
6- Use forward observers to spot and adjust fire
H- Execute suppression, illumination, and counter-battery missions
m- Understand the doctrinal context of nuclear and chemical artillery delivery in Cold War-era planning
**WARNING: Hostile ground forces are present on the map. Players must now conduct Artillery Operations and maintain situational awareness of enemy movements.**
### Doctrinal Context:

Artillery is often called the  King of Battle  due to its decisive effect in offensive and defensive operations. During the Cold War, NATO and Warsaw Pact forces relied on massive artillery barrages to disrupt formations, fix enemy forces, and shape the battlefield before decisive maneuver. Doctrinal concepts such as deep fires, counterfire zones, and pre-planned fire missions were central to shaping enemy behavior and protecting friendly forces. Artillery coordination required integration with the FSCC, forward observers, and intelligence elements to ensure fires were accurate, timely, and synchronized. This tutorial brings those principles to life, providing players with a foundational understanding of artillery dominating the modern battlefield.
