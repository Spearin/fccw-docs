A violent NATO counterattack north of Nurnberg though threatens all of the Warsaw Pact gains made in northern Bavaria. Throughout the day the division has thrown its remaining units in the direction of the city of Forcheim, scene of bloody fighting since the pre-dawn hours. The division commander has gone missing after heading to Forcheim to rally the last counterattack. When it became apparent that the late morning counterattack had failed to stop the West Germans, the new division commander was pleased to hear veteran 72nd Panzer Regiment had not been committed yet. Orders were quickly sent out for the regiment to strike south and destroy the West German's and defender the Fatherland, AT ALL COST!
