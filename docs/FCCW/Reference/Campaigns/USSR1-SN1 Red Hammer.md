# Red Hammer

*23 July 1989, 1000hrs, Near the town of Melsungen, Germany - West-German vs Soviet forces*



For three days now NATO forces have been on the defensive. They have fought better than expected and have not broken. There have been several battles where Soviet firepower has shattered NATO forces but the same is true for some of our own forces. 

The time has come to release the Red Hammer. This operation is intended to breakthrough to the Rhine River. NATO reserves and reinforcements have been diverted to other parts of the front. This area is the boundary of the remains of the 1st Belgian Corps and the 3rd West German Corps. 

3It's time to swing the Red Hammer and end this war!
