# Holding the Line

*28 July 1989, 0500hrs, Schotten, Germany   United States vs Soviet forces*



CAfter being slowed down by a valiant effort by the 1-36 Mechanized Battalion (Mech Bn), the 1 Guards Tank Army has been picking up speed as they head towards Frankfurt.  The 20th Motor Rifle Division (MRD) after some heavy fighting, has pushed a second echelon Motor Rifle Regiment (MRR) through a gap Southwest along B257. 

The 67 MRR is advancing towards the road network hub of Schotten.  NATO destruction of some key bridges has resulted in the MRR being separated from their parent division in many ways.  Also, the lead Motor Rifle Battalion is further ahead of the follow-on Battalions than usual. 

Your successful block South of Lauterbach meant that you did not have as much time as you liked to get your defense set up.  However, your Battalion has returned to their defensive locations, received some replacements and is ready to stop the 67 MRR.
