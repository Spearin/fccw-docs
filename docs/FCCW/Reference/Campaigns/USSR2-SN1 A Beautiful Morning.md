# A Beautiful Morning

*20 July 1989, 0500hrs, Erbendorf, West Germany   West German vs Soviet forces*



The war against NATO begins this morning.  NATO forces are slowly moving forward into their planned war positions.  Along the Waldnaab and Fichtelnaab Rivers, a territorial Infantry Battalion has moved into position to hold the bridges along the A93 and B299.     

FThe 79th Airmobile Brigade s first mission is to capture bridges East of Erbendorf near the A93.  The plan is for them to hold the bridges until the 12th Guards Tank Division arrives around 1400.  The 1st Battalion has the task to seize the bridges near Windischeschenbach and to protect the Northwestern flank of the Brigade. 

NOTE:  The area East of the long minefield is intended to be behind Soviet lines. NATO air defences are not able to reach into the area and none of their direct or indirect weapons will engage in this area.
