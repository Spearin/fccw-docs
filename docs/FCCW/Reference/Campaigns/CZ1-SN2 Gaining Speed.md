Both alliances have been preparing for war but, the Warsaw Pact believes that it has the advantage and the final orders for the attack have been issued. NATO forces have been slowed down in their movement to their initial defensive locations, hampered by peace demonstrations and Spetsnaz activities.  The West German forces are just now arriving at what the Warsaw Pact believes is their defence areas.   The 1st Czechoslovakian Army is ready to attack towards NUREMBURG, with two divisions in the first echelon.  The 49th Motor Rifle Regiment (MRR) is in the first echelon for the 20th Motor Rifle Division (MRD) and ready to secure PEGNITZ by noon on 22 Jul.
