# *Night Knights*

V**21 July 1989, 2200hrs, Lichtenfels, West Germany - West Germans vs East Germans**Â 

At this stage, the *Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) 4. Motorisierte Schtzendivision (4. MSD)* moved further east and adopted a purely defensive posture, effectively removing them from the operational battle. Meanwhile, to their northwest, the *11. Motorisierte Schtzendivision  (11. MSD)* pushed south to secure the B4 highway, containing pockets of resistance for the advancing Warsaw Pact forces to annihilate.



*Panzerbattalion 363 (PzBtl 363)* was relieved by *Panzerbattalion 361 (PzBtl 361)*, and fell back to the B4, joined by *Panzergrenadierbattalion 364 (PzGrenBtl 364)*, preparing for a northward maneuver. By this point, their initial guarding mission was complete as the  *3rd Infantry Division (3ID)* began its northward advance toward Bad Knigshofen, catching the *8th Guards Army (8 GA)* off guard.



1Now, a full-scale counteroffensive was set to begin. *Panzerbrigade 36 (PzBrig 36)*, supported by all available firepower, advanced into the Lichtenfels district, screening the Spartan Brigade on its eastern flank and driving north along the B4 toward the "Coburg Gap."



This action had three objectives: to screen the *2nd Brigade 3rd Infantry Division (2BDE 3 ID)* during its advance, secure a staging area for future offensives, and clear a path toward the American forces still encircled near Coburg.
