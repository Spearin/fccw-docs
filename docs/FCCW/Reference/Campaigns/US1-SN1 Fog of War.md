# Scenario Briefing: A Fog of War



Location: Westhausen

Date: July 23,1989   Day+3 @ 1800hrs

5Opposing Forces: United States vs Soviet Union



Having lost all communication, the 1 ID (Fwd) had to assume the First Armored Division (1 AD) was incapacitated. The American resistance, caught off guard and lacking reinforcements, was collapsing. German territories struggled against the swift-moving Soviet echelons, predominantly composed of Ukrainian forces operating in small, fast armored groups. These units frequently deviated from highways, spreading out over the Landstrasse, and bypassing strong points. The situation grew increasingly desperate as the enemy advanced rapidly and information became scarcer.



The 1ID(Fwd), the sole unit in the area with significant staying power, was still reeling from earlier chemical strikes on their bases. However, they couldn't reorganize quickly enough to deploy forcefully to their planned battle positions. Those who evacuated were largely separated from the main body, leaving the brigade-sized force scattered. C Troop of the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry (C/1-4 CAV), was dispatched to the vicinity of Westhausen to assess the size and direction of the advancing Soviet forces. The Soviets had recently turned south, seemingly with the intent of bringing their tanks close to Central Army Group (CENTAG) rear assets in Stuttgart.



Anticipating encounters with divisional reconnaissance forces, the mission was clear: deny the enemy information and buy time for the brigade to regroup. The local terrain, marked by well-spaced hills and valleys, offered ideal ambush opportunities. Conversely, the more open terrain on the eastern approach to the Autobahn 7 was advantageous for one surviving American asset that had proven deadly and resilient throughout the war   combat aviation in the form of attack helicopter squadrons. Eager for revenge and equipped with freshly replenished munitions, the pilots were enthusiastic about inflicting damage and clearing the persistent Fog of War.
