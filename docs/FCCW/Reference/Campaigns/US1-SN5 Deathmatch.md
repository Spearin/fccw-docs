5Opposing Forces: United States vs Soviet Union



Despite the dramatic decimation of the 48 MRD, its intended impact was not realized once the dust settled. The leading units of the 1ID (Fwd) found themselves backpedaling after exhausting their ammunition, as additional waves of the Red Army swiftly arrived. The 31st Tank Division (31 TD) launched attacks on the German flanks while the 30th Guards Motorized Rifle Division (30 GMRD) patched up gaps in the advance, supported by the Czechoslovakian rearguard now pushing westward. Salvaging what remained of the 48 MRD, the Soviet rearguard reorganized the survivors into a battle-weary yet resolute battalion, tasked with completing their mission at any cost, assured of the full support of the entire Army Corps.

 

Despite the steadfastness of the FschjgBtl 253, they were eventually driven out of the town of Kirchheim and pursued across the Neckar River, suffering significant losses. Compounding their plight, the 20th Motorized Rifle Division (20 MRD) breached the German defenses in the north, effectively trapping the FschjgBtl 253. In response, a decision was made to reposition the 1ID (Fwd) southward to evade encirclement and establish a defensive stance in more challenging terrain.



aAs a Prepositioned Organizational Materiel Configured to Unit Sets (POMCUS) unit, the remaining forces of the Big Red One finally arrived in Mannheim, albeit belatedly, largely due to Soviet special operations and long-range strikes. The grim realization dawned on the Colonel that by the time the 1st Infantry Division could maneuver southward to reinforce their brigade, the Russians would likely have crossed the Neckar River and engaged them before they could establish a cohesive defense. Consequently, they had no alternative but to retreat southwestward, seeking refuge with the Canadian forces.
