# *Coburg Pocket*

g**24 July 1989, 10:00hrs, Coburg, West Germany - U.S. and West Germans vs. Soviet and East Germans** 

As the war erupted across Franconia, the Hindenburg Kaserne in Coburg was obliterated in a surprise attack that marked the beginning of intense hostilities. The **4th Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment (4 SQD, 4 CAV)** conducting a routine border patrol was caught off guard by devastating artillery barrages and a sudden communications blackout. Within hours, the Soviet **39th Guards Motor Rifle Division (39 GMRD)** bypassed Coburg, leaving a trail of destruction: Bravo Troop annihilated, squadron headquarters and the Air Cavalry unit neutralized by a VX gas attack, and Alpha Troop trapped in the rugged hills southeast of Rdental.



tThe Nationale Volksarmee **11th Motorized Rifle Division (11. MSD)** was tasked with securing the strategic B4 route. Their orders were to contain the remaining U.S. forces, preventing their escape and clearing the way for the Soviet **20 GMRD** to deliver the finishing blow. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the American troopers leveraged their intimate knowledge of the terrain and Soviet tactics to mount a tenacious defense. A handful of M3 Bradleys conducted harassing actions, delaying entire regiments. Yet, their situation grew increasingly dire with dwindling supplies, exhaustion, and no relief.



Relief came in **Panzerbrigade 36 (PzBrig 36)** after a grueling fight through the **11. MSD** the previous day, the brigade spearheaded by **Panzerbataillon 363 (PzBtl 363)** was advancing north. Their path was marked by the wreckage of NVA T-55s from **Panzerregiment 11 (PR-11)**, leaving no doubt of their momentum. The German armor s mission was twofold: break through to the besieged U.S. forces and destroy the remnants of the **11.MSD** then prepared to blunt the advancing Soviet forces.



The stakes were high. Holding Coburg was critical to denying the Soviets a vital entry point into West Germany and securing the flank for a major NATO counteroffensive brewing further east. As **PzBrig 36** thundered north, the clock was ticking for the defenders of the Coburg Pocket.
