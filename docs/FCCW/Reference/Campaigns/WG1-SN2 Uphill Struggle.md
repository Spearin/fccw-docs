# *Uphill Struggle*

S**20 July 1989, 0300hrs, Bamberg, West Germany   West Germans vs. East Germans**Â 

Following their decisive destruction of the **4. Motorisierte Schtzendivision (4. MSD)** spearhead,** PzBrig 36,** pivoted east toward the still-smoldering ruins of Schesslitz. The area had already become a crucible of combat, leaving the Warsaw Pact in partial control.



WBy the previous night s end, Pact forces had established fire dominance over Schesslitz and the critical Bundestrasse B505 and B22 highways. This control secured a vital approach to Bamberg, putting NATO forces in a precarious position. The B505/B22 route offered the** Nationale Volksarmee (NVA)** a direct line to Hassfurt key for the recently withdrawn **2nd Brigade (Spartan), 3rd Infantry Division (2BDE, 3ID)** to re-enter the fight. Complicating matters, the **3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division (3BDE, 1AD)** was regrouping south of Bamberg, exposed to renewed enemy pressure.



CThe strategic stakes were high. Securing Bamberg would give the Warsaw Pact control over the vital B279 highway, a critical artery for NATO s **12. Panzerdivision (12. PzDiv)**. Losing it would not only isolate 2BDE and 3ID s objective at Bad Knigshofen but also disrupt their supply routes as they pushed north.



As dawn neared, the battered **Motorisierte Schtzenregiment 21 (MSR-21)** of the NVA had entrenched themselves on the commanding high ground surrounding Schesslitz. This terrain dominated the town and the B505/B22 routes, creating a natural chokepoint. Overnight, Soviet reinforcements, led by the fresh **Panzerregiment 4 (PR-4)**, began executing a forward passage of lines to seize Schesslitz and drive northwest. Meanwhile, **Motorisierte Schtzenregiment 23 (MSR-23)** prepared to intercept the advancing American forces, aiming to delay them long enough for follow-on Soviet echelons to consolidate and press their offensive.



0The West Germans were not caught off guard. The** Panzerkampfgruppe (PzKpfGr)** deployed their forces precisely, ready to meet the enemy s downhill charge head-on. As the first light crept over the battlefield, their resolve was clear: crush the Soviet advance in a single, decisive engagement.
