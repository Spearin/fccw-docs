# *Leading the Way*

W**20 July 1989, 14:00 hrs, Ebelsbach, West Germany   West Germans vs. East Germans**Â 

The unthinkable had happened: the 48-hour General Defense Plan (GDP) was rendered useless by a sudden, unanticipated Warsaw Pact offensive. Despite suffering from heavy jamming, relentless airstrikes, and precision surface-to-surface missile (SSM) attacks, **Panzerbataillon 363 (PzBtl 363)** rapidly mustered from its peacetime positions. Rushed mobilization saw them rolling into action under fragmented communications and with only a hazy battlefield picture. By mid-morning, reports of friendly and enemy positions were sparse, leaving much of the brigade fighting blind. After nearly eight grueling hours, **PzBrig 36** began to coalesce, reforming into a cohesive combat force as the need for action reached critical urgency.



Intelligence painted a grim picture. Elements of the **Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) 4. Motorisierte Schtzendivision (4. MSD)** had been spotted bypassing Bamberg and pushing west. Civilian reports confirmed the enemy avoided urban centers where the **1st Armored Division (1 AD)** and **2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (2 ACR)** were mounting stubborn defenses. Instead, the **4. MSD** aimed for Hassfurt, a critical pre-war staging area for the **Second "Spartan" Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division (3 ID)**. Under the GDP, the Spartans were tasked with a decisive thrust northward toward Bad Knigshofen, targeting the nerve center of the **8th Guards Army (8 GA)**.



But the war s sudden onset forced all plans into disarray. **PzDiv 12** and the Spartans were caught off guard and forced to adapt under fire. For the West Germans, the mission was clear: the Spartans  movements must remain undetected and unimpeded at all costs.



Attempts to establish contact with the **2 ACR** failed, dangerously exposing the left flank. With no time to waste, **PzBrig 36** was ordered to advance from Bad Mergentheim to Ebelsbach, establishing the Main River as their line of departure. **PzBtl 363**, hastily task-organized and supported by the brigade's assets, was chosen to spearhead the operation. The battalion s Leopard 2 tanks would lead the charge into the teeth of the enemy s advance, setting the stage for a brutal clash at Ebelsbach.



As the sun dipped lower in the sky, the men of PzBtl 363 prepared for their moment. Their mission was clear: to fight the enemy and ensure the path to victory remained open.
