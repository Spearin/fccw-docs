# *Operation Entgleisen*

Z**24 July 1989, 08:00hrs, Lichtenfels, West Germany - West Germans vs. Soviets Forces**Â 

**Panzerbrigade 36 (PzBrig 36)** operated in what should have been the enemy's rear area or at least it would have been had a continuous frontline still existed. The brigade was at the edge of its communication range with 12 Panzerdivision (12 PzDiv)**, and relentless Soviet electronic warfare (EW) interference complicated already tenuous coordination. Sporadic and fragmented reports indicated Soviet activity on all sides, including unverified claims that the enemy had advanced as far as Heilbronn.



For the troops, such rumors were a bitter pill. If Heilbronn had fallen, Bad Mergentheim had likely also succumbed to the Soviet advance. Each passing day reinforced a grim reality: the forward NATO defenses had collapsed, local Territorial Army units were still scrambling to organize, and the specter of a nuclear escalation loomed larger.



Yet, all was not lost. NATO forces had secured the Coburg Gap, and the troops that had pushed the Soviets back to the border regrouped with a renewed sense of purpose. If the Soviets had plunged deep into Baden-Wrttemberg, their logistical lines would be overextended, presenting an opportunity for exploitation.



At dawn on 24 July, **PzBrig 36** developed a bold counteroffensive plan. **Panzerbataillon 361 (PzBtl 361)** battered and nearly combat-ineffective after holding the eastern flank of the B4 highway against relentless Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) and Soviet attacks, was absorbed into** Panzerbataillon 363 (PzBtl 363)**, which had itself endured days of heavy fighting. Meanwhile,** Panzerbataillon 362 (PzBtl 362)** and **Panzergrenadierbataillon 364 (PzGrenBtl 364)** spearhead the brigade s renewed offensive effort.
