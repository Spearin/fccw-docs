*24 July 1989, 0500hrs, East of Marburg, Germany - West-German vs Soviet forces*



After overrunning the light territorial forces defending Melsungen, the Soviet juggernaut continued their westwards advance unhindered. 

Not having the necessary forces to stop the Soviets, NATO decided to gain more time by placing another West-German territorial force on their path. 

This time however, the challenge would be greater as NATO deployed an entire territorial brigade in the path of the advancing Soviets.
