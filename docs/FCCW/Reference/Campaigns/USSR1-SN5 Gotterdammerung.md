# Gotterdammerung

*27 July 1989, 0800hrs, North of Neuwied, Germany - US vs Soviet forces*



With the Rhein in sight, the Soviet forces gained a new lease of life. The sight of their target meant that they were but a short effort away from achieving their goals.Â 

Unfortunately, this also meant that NATO had strong reasons to defend this area. The Soviet forces were under no illusions regarding their task. While they knew that they were only a stone's throw away from their target, they knew that this last push would prove the hardest.
