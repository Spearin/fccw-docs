# Stop Gap

*26 July 1989, 1100hrs, Lauterbach, Germany   United States vs Soviet forces*



#The 1st Guards Tank Army has made significant gains in the early stage of the war. The successful attack at Fulda has changed many timelines.  The 20th Motor Rifle Division (MRD) is leading one avenue of approach out of Fulda.   A Tank Division is close behind, ready to exploit any opening. 

The 20th MRD is currently attacking the 1-48 Mechanized Battalion Northeast of Lauterbach.  Their attack has caught the US Battalion off guard and it will not be long before the 20th MRD will be able to push through.  

The 1-36 Mechanized Battalion was getting ready to defend in the Schotten area, when they received new orders to block the 20th MRD.
