# Epilogue

*7 August 1989, 0800hrs, Arracourt, France - French vs Soviet forces*



HAs the Soviets continue to aggressively push west, the major concern in NATO's HQ is followed by a perception of opportunity. In the famous battlefield of Arracourt, they decide the open area is conducive to a trap. NATO aims to obliterate the 11th Tank Division that is now conveniently grouped along a single axis of advance.  

After the Soviets opened the Pandora's box of nuclear weapons, an opportunittic nuclear strike obliterates the 11th Tank Division's spearhead. Showing a merciless disposition, the reminder of the division continues to push forward, using the edges of the radioactive battlefield as flank protection.  

The battered 16GC is, for a change, on the attack. The 1DB concentrates all resources into the counter-strike as the reminder of the 11th Tank Division finds itself between a radioactive battlefield and the advancing French.
