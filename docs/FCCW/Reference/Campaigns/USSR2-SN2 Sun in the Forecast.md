*22 July 1989, 0500hrs, Kinding, West Germany   West German vs Soviet forces*



NATO has been unable to stop the advance of the Soviets, especially in the gap between Frankfurt and Munich.  NATO continues to push forces forward as they arrive, but they are finding it hard to stop the penetrations across the front.     

The 79th Airmobile Brigade first mission was successful.  The Brigade managed to seize the bridges and hand them over to the 12 Guards Tanks Division.  The Brigade was then pulled back to rest and recover before the next task.  Forty Eight hours after landing near Erbendorf, the Brigade is being sent into battle.  This attack is a day earlier than the initial plan called for, but the Brigade is off to Kinding to secure a key road node along the A9. 

NOTE:  The area in the southeast corner behind the minefield is intended to be behind Soviet lines. NATO air defences are not able to reach into the area and none of their direct or indirect weapons will engage in this area.
