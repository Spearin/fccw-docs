On July 20, 1989, the Warsaw Pact began Operation Krasnyy Zapad. The invasion of Western Europe. There is heavy fighting all along the front line. Due to the heavy pressure, the NATO troops cannot hold their ground everywhere and are slowly being forced back. 

Due to the pullback of NATO troops, a gap has arisen near the town of Soest. The East-German 7 Panzer Division receives the order to use this gap in the front line to break through to the Rhine via town of Soest. The East-German Panzer Regiment 15, who had been held in reserve, was assigned this task. 

To defend the town of Soest and delay the East German attack  NATO had only a Belgian Combat battalion, the 4th Lancers, available. The first reinforcements, a British Company Task Group and Artillery, could arrive within a few hours.
