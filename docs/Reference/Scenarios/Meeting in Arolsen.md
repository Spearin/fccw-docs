# Meeting in Arolsen

*24 July 1989, 1400hrs, Arolsen, Germany - Belgian, vs Soviet forces*



With the front in a fluid state, the Soviet 6th Guards Tank Division was instructed to conduct an advance into what was expected to be a weak spot on the West German defence line.  

Unfortunately for NATO, the timing of the movement coincided with a consolidation movement of the West German forces, the ultimate result being that the Soviet forces met with thin air and plunged into a gap. At the same time as the West Germans tried desperately to close the open wound, it was obvious to NATO's command that the fast-moving spearhead needed to be stopped otherwise the entire Soviet division would soon find itself behind NATO's lines. 

AThe Belgian 17me Brigade Blinde had an advanced element east of Arolsen. The advanced element per se could not stop even a recon in force, much less the entire spearhead of the 6th Guards Tank Division. However, the 17me Brigade Blinde was ordered to quickly move reinforcements forward to meet the advancing Soviets.
