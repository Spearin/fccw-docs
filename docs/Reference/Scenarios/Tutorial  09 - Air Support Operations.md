# Tutorial 09   Air Support Operations


### Accessing the Tutorial:

5To begin this tutorial, open the **Help** menu within Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War. Navigate to the **Field Manuals** folder and locate the **FM FCCW-03R5 Tutorial Operations.pdf** file. Follow the instructions in **Section 9** to launch **Tutorial 09: Fixed-Wing Air Support Operations.**c*  **NOTE: Only Playable from Player 1**
### Tutorial Overview:

Fixed-Wing Air Support Operations are a critical component of modern combat, enabling joint force commanders to deliver responsive and overwhelming firepower supporting ground operations. This tutorial introduces players to the coordinated employment of air assets across a range of mission types, including:

1- Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)
- Close Air Support (CAS)
- Heavy Air Support (HAS)
- Gunship Support (GSS)
Using a combination of fixed-wing attack aircraft, strategic bombers, and specialized gunships, players will learn how to plan, task, and execute air missions that degrade enemy capabilities, support maneuver units, and shape the battlespace.

While the tutorial focuses on conventional air support, it also addresses the doctrinal context of nuclear and chemical strike capabilities. Although not used in the scenario, understanding these escalation options is essential for appreciating Cold War-era airpower doctrines.

### Prerequisites:

gThis tutorial is intended for new and returning players. You should complete the earlier tutorials in the series to familiarize yourself with user interface controls, unit tasking, and basic operational mechanics. Prior exposure to artillery and reconnaissance operations will enhance your understanding of coordination between ground and air elements.

_  **NOTE: This tutorial will include limited hostile ground forces, allowing players to focus on Air Support Operations with minimal combat pressure.**
### Learning Objectives:

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to employ fixed-wing aircraft in various tactical roles and effectively integrate air support into your battle plan. You will learn how to:

0**Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD):**%- To establish air superiority, neutralize or destroy enemy air defense systems, such as radar arrays, surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites, and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Effective SEAD operations reduce the threat to friendly aircraft and enable freedom of action in the air domain.
**Close Air Support (CAS):**- Deliver timely and accurate air strikes close to friendly ground forces. CAS missions use attack aircraft and tactical bombers to engage enemy personnel, armored vehicles, and fortified positions, directly influencing the outcome of ground engagements.
**Heavy Air Support (HAS):**- Employ strategic bombers, such as the B-52 Stratofortress, to conduct long-range attacks on high-value enemy targets. HAS operations target infrastructure, supply depots, command centers, and massed enemy formations, significantly disrupting operational depth and tempo.
**Gunship Support (GSS):**- Utilize aircraft like the AC-130 gunship to deliver persistent, precise, and heavily concentrated fire support. GSS is especially effective during nighttime or in complex environments, offering close overwatch and sustained fire on enemy positions.

### Doctrinal Note: Nuclear and Chemical Strike Capabilities

Air-delivered nuclear and chemical weapons, while not employed in this scenario, were an integral part of Cold War air doctrine. Understanding their theoretical use and strategic implications helps frame the broader role of airpower in Cold War conflict planning.
