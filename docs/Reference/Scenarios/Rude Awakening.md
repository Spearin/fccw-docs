*21 July 1989, 0400hrs, Fulda  United States vs Soviet forces*



The Soviet push on Jul 20th overwhelmed a NATO defense that was not in place.  The Soviets had breached screens across the Front.  NATO had been caught by surprise and the Soviets were taking advantage.Â 

The ferocity of Soviet air attacks had surprised the NATO air force and the Soviets had achieved early air superiority. The Spetsnaz attacks across Western Europe had been very effective.  These attacks added confusion and tasks to units already struggling to get into position.



UThe Soviet advance was progressing well, and they were pushing towards Fulda and Bad Hersfeld.  The Army Commander decided by noon on July 20th that an airmobile attack would be launched early the next morning to the West of Fulda.  The goal was to capture some key bridges and take out an airfield supporting the NATO covering force.



Meanwhile, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) Headquarters were in Fulda and a Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP) was located just to the West of the city.  Around midnight, I Troop finally arrived into the area after surviving some air and Spetsnaz attacks.
