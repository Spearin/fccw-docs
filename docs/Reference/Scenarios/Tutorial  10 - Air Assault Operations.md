# Tutorial 10   Air Assault Operations


### Accessing the Tutorial:

5To begin this tutorial, open the **Help** menu within Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War. Navigate to the **Field Manuals** folder and locate **FM FCCW-03/R5 Tutorial Operations.pdf** file. Follow the instructions provided in **Section 13** to launch **Tutorial 10: Air Assault Operations.**

c*  **NOTE: Only Playable from Player 1**
### Tutorial Overview:

Air Assault Operations represent a cornerstone of modern airmobile warfare, enabling rapid deployment of troops and combat power into critical terrain, often deep behind enemy lines or in areas otherwise inaccessible to ground forces. This tutorial introduces players to the planning, execution, and tactical employment of rotary-wing assets to insert infantry, secure landing zones, and project combat power with speed, precision, and flexibility.

zPlayers will coordinate aviation and ground elements for a full-spectrum air assault mission. Key concepts include:

6- Selection and security of Landing Zones (LZs)
A- Coordinated helicopter insertion of air assault infantry
M- Use of air escorts to suppress enemy threats en route and around LZs
R- Rapid consolidation and expansion of a lodgment within the objective area
J- Timely extraction or reinforcement if the mission profile demands
This scenario provides a practical, hands-on introduction to integrating rotary-wing aviation into combined arms operations. It demonstrates how Air Assault units achieve tactical surprise and gain positional advantage in offensive and defensive operations.

b  **NOTE: This scenario is intentionally challenging and may sometimes feel difficult or impossible. This high difficulty is by design and offers valuable learning opportunities.**
### Prerequisites:

This tutorial is intended for new and returning players. You should complete the previous tutorials to develop proficiency in game mechanics, unit tasking, and support operations. Familiarity with artillery, reconnaissance, and air support coordination will improve your effectiveness in this advanced scenario.

### Learning Objectives:

After completing this tutorial, you will understand how to plan and conduct air assault missions using helicopter-borne infantry and supporting aircraft. You will learn to:

-**Helicopter Insertion of Ground Forces:**- Deploy infantry and equipment into forward or contested terrain using rotary-wing transport aircraft. Learn how to time insertion flights, avoid high-threat areas, and coordinate multiple flight waves when needed.1**Securing and Managing Landing Zones (LZs):**Select and prepare LZs with consideration for terrain, threat level, and proximity to objectives. Understand how to secure LZs using lead elements and escorting assets to ensure safe troop delivery and resupply.
**Air Escort and Suppression:**- Employ attack helicopters and close air escort assets to neutralize enemy threats along ingress and egress routes, enabling successful troop delivery with minimal losses.
**Establishing a Foothold:**- Rapidly consolidate forces post-insertion to secure objectives, repel counterattacks, and hold terrain. Emphasis is placed on speed, momentum, and maintaining initiative immediately after landing.

### Doctrinal Context:

DAir Assault Operations demand high levels of synchronization between aviation and ground units. Drawing from Cold War-era doctrine, this tutorial emphasizes air mobility as a force multiplier used for rapid deployment and deep strikes, vertical envelopment, and operational flexibility across varied mission profiles.
