# Eyes, Ears and Teeth

*21 July 1989, 0700hrs, Near MARBURG, Germany - United States vs Soviet forces*



5As the 3rd Amored Division fights in the Fulda Gap the offensive further south in the Hof Gap also develops.  The Soviet spearheads seem to be everywhere at the same time.  Communications are not the best.  Many units have ceased to exist.  Others are still fighting for their lives as the tide surges forward 

That s all well and good but it doesn t make Generals happy to have a void on a map.  But what to do about it?  There are no units to send to see what s happening. 

For the Americans, there is an ad hoc unit sort of that could be called upon to do a reconnaissance in force mission.  There have been several vehicles brought in for repairs.  The 11th ACR has been forming up personnel to accept some of their repaired equipment back.  Where they found the extra men is a mystery but CENTAG isn t looking any gift horses in the mouth.  Especially Blackhorses! So, the unit is formed.  Task Force EET is to move into the area of Hammelburg and report on enemy activity.  

For the Soviets, they have sent a reinforced reconnaissance battalion into the gap.  They are probing the area looking for weaknesses and more importantly a gap!
