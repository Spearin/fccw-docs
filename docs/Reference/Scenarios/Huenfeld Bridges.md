# Hnfeld Bridges

*30 July 1989, 0700hrs, Hnfeld   West German vs Soviet forces*

NATO s counter attack continues to be successful and the Soviets are on their heels, getting pushed back across the front.  The focus of operations North of Fulda is on the bridges in Hnfeld and the connection to the B84 heading into East Germany. 1Soviet forces are reeling.  Between being stopped short of Frankfurt and now being pushed East, morale is slipping.  To make matters worse, supply lines throughout the Warsaw Pact are being targeted by NATO air and missile attacks.  This is causing major supply issues for Soviet forces in West Germany.   "The 20th Motor Rifle Division (MRD) has fallen back and has been tasked with holding open a corridor between East Germany and the Soviet forces North of Fulda.  The key to this are the bridges around Hnfeld along with the B84 and secondary roads running West.  The 242nd Motor Rifle Regiment (MRR) had been in heavy combat until July 28th.  When they were pulled back to rest, resupply as much as they could and move into a defensive position near Hnfeld.  To their West, 67th MRR is defending the corridor on the other side of the Fulda River. #At the same time, the 13th West German Panzergrenadier Brigade has moved into position West of Bad Hersfeld to begin an attack South towards Hnfeld.  They have air support and some attack helicopter support ready for this attempt to cut the supply line to the Soviet forces West of Fulda.
