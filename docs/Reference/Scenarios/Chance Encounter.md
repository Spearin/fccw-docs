# Chance Encounter

*11 Aug 1989, 0500hrs, Bad Driburg, Germany - British vs Soviet forces*



dWith chaos still dominating the battlefield, gaps naturally formed between NATO's defensive pockets.pThis was expected by both sides. As the Soviets tried to exploit said gaps, so did NATO endeavour to close them. 

One thing that was also common was the need to recon these gaps. Aerial and satellite recon were major forces in this endeavour, but they struggled to provide real time data. Sometimes the boots on the ground had to do this work. Such was the case in Bad Driburg. A corridor, between Kassel and Bielefeld, where NATO had strong defensive positions, and leading straight to Paderborn. From here the B64 highway split north and south and would allow a roaming force to appear behind NATO's defensive positions. 

Given this, both sides decided to confirm if the area was free of enemy forces. One to advance through it, the other to determine if it had to quickly close this gap.!
