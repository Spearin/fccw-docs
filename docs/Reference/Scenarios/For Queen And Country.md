*13 Aug 1989, 0500hrs, Geseke, Germany - British vs Soviet forces*



The NORTHAG counterattack did not surprise the Pact forces. Even if expected, their extended defensive lines were slowly being rolled back and some areas were crumbling under pressure.  

In the Soviet 3rd Shock Army area, the British forces quickly punched a hole and then advanced with abandonment, much in the way Pact forces had done early in the war. The British were doing a gamble. Their gamble was that they could join the US forces that were advancing from the south, before the Soviets could react in force and seal them in a pocket. 

On paper, the advancing blue arrow looked quite menacing. In reality, the British were starting to run against the clock. Typical of their advancement was the action in the Geseke area.Retreating Soviets placed yet another strong roadblock on the way of the British. This needed clearing ASAP to ensure there were no further delays to their already compromised timetable.!
