# The First Dance



Map:  Norderfurt

#July 20, 1989 - Day 1 @ 0300

Forces:  U.S. vs Soviets



Special: *This scenario is an introduction to the new Tactical Transport system developed for Flashpoint Campaigns and released with the Central Storm module. This system will allow you to conduct an air assault with transport helicopters supported by attack helicopters.*



Notice: *This scenario was designed before the AI could perform a Tactical Transport mission. It was originally designed to be played by the Soviet player only. However, once a Tactical Transport mission for the Battle Planner was develop, it was added to the scenario. So, the scenario can be played from the NATO side but it probably will not be as rewarding as playing from the Soviet side. It is recommended that the player play the Soviet side first before attempting the scenario as NATO.*



-The day that we have all been waiting for has finally arrived. Today is the day that we liberate our European neighbor by driving the Americans and their puppet dictators out. In just a few hours our glorious forces will storm through the border inflicting death and destruction upon our enemy.



You, comrades, have a huge honor bestowed upon you. You will have the opportunity to inflict the first blows against our enemy. While your comrades are clearing the border with their tanks and armored vehicles, you will be flown across the border to impede and inflict as much damage on the enemy while they are still unorganized and trying to get into position to stop our forces. The longer you can delay the American forces, the farther our ground force will be able to advance.



Good Hunting, Comrades!
