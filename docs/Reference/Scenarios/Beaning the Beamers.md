# Beaning the Beamers

*20 July 1989, 0300hrs, Landau an der Isar, West Germany - West-German vs. Czechoslovakian forces*



Shortly after 0100, reports started coming from recon forces stationed along the border with Czechoslovakia that Warsaw Pact forces were crossing the border en masse. NATO soldiers were alerted to report to their units and mobilize for war. Units were rushed forward to meet the Warsaw Pact onslaught. Â 

Just West of this map on the A92 is the town of Dingolfing, which contains the largest BMW plant in the world. Capturing Dingolfing and the BMW plant would be a significant moral victory for the Czechs.
