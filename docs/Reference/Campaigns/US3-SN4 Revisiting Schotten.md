# Revisiting Schotten

*31 July 1989, 0300hrs, Schotten, Germany   United States vs Soviet forces*

The Soviet attack on the main defense line did not go very well.  The lead divisions hit the wall hard and have not recovered.  They did get some limited breakthroughs, but these quickly turned into more trouble as NATO artillery and air support helped stop and then destroy any forces that penetrated the line. 

A US counterattack at Nidda broke through the lead Soviet division.  The Soviet 9th Tank Division, weakened, tired and low on supply, has moved into blocking positions to contain the US advance. 

Following your successful counterattack near Nidda, the Battalion had a short time to catch their breath.  The Brigade commander needs you to exploit North, back to Schotten.  Intelligence reports indicate that the Soviets have moved some nuclear capable BM-21 rocket launchers into the area.  These are a high value target that need to be removed.  Air strikes are planned, but NATO wants confirmation that they have been destroyed.
