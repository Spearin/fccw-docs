# *One Last Catfight*

**25 July 1989, 17:00 hrs, Kulmbach, West Germany   West Germans vs. Soviets, East Germans, and Czechoslovak Forces.**



The operation had been a hard-fought success. In a relentless sweep through the operational hinterland, Panzerbrigade 36 had inflicted significant damage on Warsaw Pact forces. Two Soviet divisions had been worn down, a third effectively annihilated, and critical supply chains running through the Coburg and Hof gaps were thrown into chaos. With luck, their actions would delay the Soviet advance by at least a day, buying precious time and weakening the effectiveness of the forward divisions.



Now came the hard part withdrawal. Ivan wasn t making it easy. Despite Panzerbattaillon 363's stellar performance, the rest of the brigade had fared far worse. Panzerbattaillon 362 and Panzergrenadierbattaillon 364 had been battered by fierce counterattacks supported by overwhelming Soviet artillery. The situation grew even grimmer as brigade-sized Warsaw Pact forces pushed south from the border, rolling over the stretched defensive screens of West German and American troops.



The U.S. 3rd Infantry Division had been forced back to the Bavarian border, while the 1st Armored Division was similarly mauled. With the dust settling over the battlefield, Panzerbrigade 36 stood alone, its flanks exposed and the enemy closing in.



The situation was dire: ammunition reserves were critically low, the soldiers were utterly exhausted, casualties were mounting, and communications were becoming unreliable. Staying in place meant annihilation, while surrender was unthinkable. The only option left was to break out.

 

Once again, Panzerbattaillon 363 was given the lead in the desperate mission to carve a path to safety. Their objective: punch through the remnants of the shattered 18th Guards Motorized Rifle Division east of the ruins of Kulmbach.



If successful, the brigade could evacuate its wounded and salvage its remaining equipment. But success came with no guarantees Warsaw Pact forces would be in relentless pursuit. A rearguard action was inevitable to buy precious time for the brigade s retreat, and the cost would be high.



ZFor Panzerbrigade 36, this would be their final stand as a cohesive fighting force.
