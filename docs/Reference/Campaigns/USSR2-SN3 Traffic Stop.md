# Traffic Stop

_*24 July 1989, 0800hrs, Kirchheim u Teck, West Germany   American vs Soviet forces*



NATO has been unable to stop the advance of the Soviets, especially in the gap between Frankfurt and Munich.  NATO continues to push forces forward as they arrive, but they are finding it hard to stop the penetrations across the front.     

The 79th Airmobile Brigade has had a couple of successful missions.  The battle at Kinding was important in helping increase the size of the hole in the NATO defence line.  The lead elements of the Warsaw Pact attack are West of Munich, near Augsburg.  NATO is sending the US 6th Infantry Division into the area.  The lead brigade is expected to be crossing the Neckar river around 0900 this morning.   

As practised during the lead up to the war, the 79th is going to be inserted into a position to delay the American forces.  The area just East of the Neckar River, near Kirchheim, has been identified as the best location for this action.   

As the Brigade starting embarking on their choppers, the Brigade Commander and his deputy were killed in an explosion.  You have been chosen to command the Brigade for this mission.  Success will bring you a promotion! 

 NOTE:  The area in the southeast corner behind the minefield is intended to be behind Soviet lines. NATO air defences are not able to reach into the area and none of their direct or indirect weapons will engage in this area.
