# Valley of Death

*25 July 1989, 1200hrs, Haiger, Germany - West-German vs Soviet forces*

To again try to stem the tide, elements of a West-German Panzer Brigade took up hasty defensive positions east of Haider. They had barely enough time to maneuver into position before the first Soviet elements were spotted.
