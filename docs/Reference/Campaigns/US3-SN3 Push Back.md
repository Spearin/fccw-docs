# Push Back

*30 July 1989, 0600hrs, Nidda, Germany   United States vs Soviet forces*



The Soviets have continued to attack the main defence line.  They have switched to the 11th Tank Division as the line weakens.  It is anticipated that they will breach the line early this morning.  The 44th Tank Regiment is poised to exploit towards Nidda.  They will likely advance along one main axis towards Nidda.Â 



After taking the brunt of the Soviet attack for over 24 hours, the 1-36 were rotated out of the line to the Southwest of Nidda. Your Battalion has had a chance to rest and recover.  Now, it is time to get back to work.  The Brigade is launching a counterattack with an Armor Battalion (Arm Bn) to the North and you in the South.  The Arm Bn is going to close the gap while your mission is going to be to destroy any Soviet forces advancing on Nidda.
