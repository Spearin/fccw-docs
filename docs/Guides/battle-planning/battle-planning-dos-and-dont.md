# Battle Planning Dos and Don’t

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


- A Battle Plan Mission adopts the Standard Operating Procedure \(SOP\) of the Force's headquarters it serves\. However, this SOP may not always align perfectly with the mission's requirements\. It is essential to review the SOP for the mission and make necessary adjustments through the Edit Button\.
- If the mission’s name doesn't suit your preferences, simply opt to modify it by choosing "Rename" from the dropdown menu accessible through the "Other" button situated to the right of the Mission list, below the "Hide" button\.
- If the Mission icon obstructs the hex where you intend to place a Waypoint \(e\.g\., with a Screen or Hold mission\), there are two methods to position the Waypoint:

1. The initial approach involves left\-clicking on the mission’s name within the "Sequential Mission List\." This action hides the mission icon on the map, enabling you to place the waypoint freely\. 
2. Alternatively, you can initially position the waypoint elsewhere and subsequently drag it to the desired hex location\.
    - Ensure that you remember to place waypoints on the map for missions that necessitate them, such as screen and hold orders \(this step is straightforward\)\. Neglecting to do so will result in the mission being left "unassigned," ultimately leading to its failure\.
    - You can allocate artillery barrage missions\. When designating a barrage mission, you can establish three waypoints\. If the force possesses multiple artillery batteries, each waypoint will be assigned a battery, starting with the first battery in the Order of Battle \(OOB\) tree\. This allows for the setup of various types of barrages\. For instance, in a scenario, you can allocate an Artillery Force with three batteries to three distinct barrage missions: smoke, persistent chemical, and non\-persistent chemical\. However, if you designate more waypoints than there are batteries available \(for example, setting three waypoints with only one or two batteries in the force\), the surplus waypoints will not be assigned barrages\.
    - To conceal the Battle Plan graphics, simply click the "Hide" button located to the right of the Mission list, beneath the "Edit" button\. To restore the graphics, click on the same button once more\.
    - Battle Plan Missions are subject to time constraints\. Upon expiration of the allotted time for a Battle Plan Mission, the unit will proceed to the subsequent mission\. It is advisable for the player to thoroughly test their Battle Plans and make necessary adjustments to ensure their proper execution\.
    - For each Battle Plan, units have the flexibility to be relocated to different setup hexes\.
    - It's not mandatory for forces to have Battle Plan Missions\. When a unit lacks a mission, the AI takes control and moves the units according to its discretion\. A Battle Plan can simply involve units or forces relocating to different locations without specific assigned missions\. Additionally, a Battle Plan may include some units or forces with missions and others without\.
    - Battle Plan Waypoints can be moved and adjusted once they are set\. 
    - Ensure that emitters such as Air Search Radar on units are activated to ensure their functionality within the Battle Planner\.
    - The entry hex for reinforcements can be adjusted for each Battle Plan\. However, currently, players cannot alter the timing of their entry\.
