# Battle Planning: Introduction

This document describes how to add Battle Plans for the AI to choose during a scenario and provides a means of replayability to any scenario for both sides in the fight\. The more plans you add the more options the player has to replay with a different enemy plan\.

We provide some of the basic "dos and don'ts" of modern tactical warfare, but not an army training manual deep\. We try to impart lessons learned from the game and those elements of real\-world tactics that apply and can save your backside in this game\.

## What's Not in this Manual\.\.\.

*How to operate the game\. *That information can be found in FM01: Game Operations\.

*How to fight in modern warfare*\. That information can be found in FM02: Battlefield Primer\.

*How to modify the game engine*\. That information can be found in FM07 through FM10\.

*Detailed information for each unit, weapon, and sensor of each country*\. You can get many of those particulars from the in\-game Sub\-Unit Inspector \(SUI\) or by searching the web\.
