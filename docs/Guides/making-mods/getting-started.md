__*FLASHPOINT CAMPAIGNS*__ is a game of grand tactical warfare as it is a construction kit with sweeping capability to make almost any modern combat situation \(Post WW2\) you want\. Before you dive headlong into a project, you should take some time to get your ducks \(or other regionally specific animals\) in a row\. This chapter of the guide breaks down a few critical decisions and works on getting you ready to work on the modification \(Mods\) you want to make\.

## Deciding What You Want to Make

It may sound like a silly question, but sometimes you may not really know what you want to mod or how far or deep you want to go\. Starting small and simple, in many cases, is a good idea\. If you want to change many things, you should take a minute and map out everything you need to do the job\. Another factor involved is the end user\. Is this something for you only, or will you make this for the public to use, too? Sometimes, it helps to be familiar with the process or tools\. If you are great at digital artwork and have image editing tools, maybe changing some of the game art is a better place to start than making a new database\. Either way you go, you need to have a desire to do it and, in some cases, support it after it is released\.

## New or Derived Content

Where do you want to start? It is no doubt easier in almost every area of the game to derive/edit existing content than to start from scratch\. If you are new to modding, I would strongly suggest starting a derived type of project first\. Having data or a format in front of you helps reduce the chance of making a mistake\. Once you are comfortable with all the ins and outs of creating the content you want from existing materials, you can switch to making it from scratch\. If you create items from scratch, make sure you are aware of and follow the rules or guidelines for formats, sizes, and ranges\. Failure to stay within the set boundaries of an object can lead to game crashes and the headaches of debugging what you have done\.

## Gathering Source Information

Before you launch into a project, take the time to gather supporting source information that can help you with what you are planning to do\. This could range from images to maps to specifications and documents\. This will be less of an issue with sounds and some art items, but a downright necessity for scenarios and data work\.

## Third\-Party Tools and Other Assets

Modding a game takes time, effort, and tools\. Modding the items in this FM requires a few 3rd party software tools\. Here is a breakdown of what you need for the specific items\.

- Graphics – Painting programs that can create or edit \*\.bmp and \*\.png images
- Sounds – \*\.wav file editing software and sound/music creators with \*\.wav output\.

So, if you want to edit items in those areas, you will need software to do so\.

## Working with User Feedback

Once you place content online for others, you must deal with positive and negative feedback and suggestions\. The best advice I can give is to be polite in your responses\. Where possible, take good suggestions and work them in\. At the end of the day, it is your work and your vision, and there is nothing wrong with telling someone to use the tools to modify it the way they like\. It’s what we are doing\!
