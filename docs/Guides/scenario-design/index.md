# Scenario Design: Introduction

This document describes how to create scenarios for the Cold War Game engine\. It also covers editing existing scenarios and the tools for updating or changing data\.

Although Battle Planning is part of the Scenario Editor and scenario creation, it is a large enough feature and new tool that we have given it its own FM to cover all its uses\. A scenario can be made without battle plans and will run based on the improved AI from Red Storm\. Battle Plans add more replayability and allow for more realistic setups for enemy AI forces\.
