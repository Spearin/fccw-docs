# Updating Scenario Data

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


Just to reiterate you can only do a Refresh in Scenario Editor mode not during the actual turn\. To update a scenario data, go to the Scenario Editor and select “Refresh Scenario Data from Disk” as shown in Figure 150\.
!!! note

    __ You only need to do this if “__your__” scenario needs to be updated with a new National Era Data\. If there is new data, it will be automatically updated to the scenarios that came with the game\.

Once you click on the “Refresh Scenario Data from Disk” a popup screen will state “Keep previous unit ammo load packages intact?” If you click the “__Yes__” button you will keep the ammo load as is, if you click the “__No__”  
button it will revert to the default load\. If you click on the “__Cancel__” button it will not proceed and will cancel the refresh scenario data\. We will click on the “__Yes__” button as shown in Figure 151\.
