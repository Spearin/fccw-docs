This section will guide you through the process of creating a campaign, with the final step covering how to edit an existing campaign\.

## Create a Campaign

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Because we’re going to put all the standalone scenarios into a campaign, we will have to select the “__Next__” button, which will take you to the Campaign Parameters window\.

1. Provide a title for the campaign\.
2. Choose the campaign player by selecting either player 1 or player 2\. The campaign can only be experienced from one side\. For this example, it will be Player 1\.
3. In this section, you'll provide a campaign description that sets the tone and provides essential information for players engaging in the campaign\.
Once you have finished the campaign parameters, select the “__Next__” button which will take you to the Campaign Scenarios selection window\. 

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Now we’re going to select the standalone scenarios for the campaign\. To do that we have to select the “__Add Scenario__” button and a “__Select and Load__” window will pop up\. As shown below\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



Here we will highlight and select the “__US1 – SN1 Fog of War__” scenario as the first scenario and then select “__Proceed__” which will return you to the Campaign Scenarios to load the next scenario until you have all the scenarios loaded\. 
!!! note

    __ Scenarios will automatically be ordered by their start dates\.


It is essential to ensure that there are at least four \(4\) hours of travel time between the end of one scenario and the start of the next\. 

The times between scenarios are critical to the core force recovery\. Don’t make them too long or too short\.

Any unused time beyond that will be used for much\-needed rest and recovery\.

Refer to __FM FCCW__ __– 04/R1 Scenario Design Chapter 4\.1\.1 Setting, Creating a New Scenario __guide__ __as your reference__\.__

Recovery Limits,

1. Allowable duration for resupply and recovery between scenarios \(ranging from 0 to a maximum of 2 hours\)\.
2. Initial percentage levels of ammunition for non\-itemized ammo types \(ranging from 1% to 100%\)\.
Once you have selected the hours of resupply and the ammo levels select the “__Subunit Replacements__” tab

The incorporation of “__Additions__” replacement equipment should be kept to a minimum\. The availability of spare units in inventory during peacetime is limited, implying that the additions primarily involve equipment cannibalized from disbanded units elsewhere\. 

If the inclusion of replacements is necessary, it is advisable to prioritize Headquarters subunit replacements generously\. 

This ensures the flexibility to reconstitute various headquarters as required between scenarios\. 

## Edit a Campaign

If you need to make a change or to update the Campaign Description select the “__Edit__” button\. If you do not need to make any changes to the Campaign parameters or Campaign Description, then select the “__Next__” button\.

> **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.



If you've created an additional scenario to add to this campaign, click the "__Add Scenario__" button\. 

In case you need to replace a scenario after making any adjustments, highlight the specific scenario and then choose the "__Reload Scenario__" button to reload only the selected scenario\. 

If you've made any adjustments to multiple scenarios and need to update them all at once, opt for the "__Reload All__" button, which will reload all scenarios simultaneously\.

If you need to remove a scenario that you don’t want in the Campaign highlight it and then use the “__Remove Scenario__” button\.

When you’re finished, then select the “__Save Campaign__” button which will cause the Save Flashpoint Campaign window to pop up\.
