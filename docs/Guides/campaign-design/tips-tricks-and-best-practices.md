Campaigns, whether in reality or the realm of PC games, inherently tell a story, with the core force serving as the primary narrative focus in FC\. Craft a coherent path from the initial scenario to the last, avoiding repetitive engagements unless essential for the campaign's storytelling\.

- “Begin with a comprehensive plan”\. Develop a concise PowerPoint presentation detailing the major forces, scenario locations and times, and the overall intent for each phase\.
- “Establish a detailed plan”, outlining the maps and forces involved\. While attention tends to focus on the Core force, the strength of the AI side across all scenarios significantly influences the required strength of the Core force\.
- “Maintain focus on a manageable scale”\. Aim for 4\-5 maps, as exceeding this threshold introduces overwhelming variables\. This minimizes the risk of an unbalanced campaign that is challenging to adjust\.
- “Prioritize testing”\. Thoroughly test scenarios to address critical questions about reinforcements, timing between scenarios, AI force strength, Core force survivability, and adequacy of AI battleplans in accounting for human actions\.
- “Consider the tempo”\. Campaigns often work best with a crescendo in tempo, allowing players to acclimate to their forces before navigating through scenarios\. This prevents the campaign from faltering in the initial stages due to insufficient force\.
- “Craft subtle descriptions”\. Without revealing too much, guide players on what to anticipate\. Warnings about force preservation may hint at stronger opposition in later scenarios, while mentions of supply difficulties signal potential replacement challenges\.
- “Provide support”\. Once the Core force, AI forces, and scenarios are defined and tested, assess balance\. If the Core force encounters challenges in specific scenarios, consider adding supporting forces\. This approach offers more control over scenario\-specific balance adjustments without disrupting the overall campaign dynamics\.
