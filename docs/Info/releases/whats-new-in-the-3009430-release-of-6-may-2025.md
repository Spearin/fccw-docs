__Data:__

\- Housekeeping\.  No changes but the housekeeping described in the 5 May release has now been extended to the Pro Contributor SVN repo\.  The first cut was made to the Dev repo, and the upcoming third cut will be made to the Beta repo\.  


__Content:__

\- "__It Begins__" updated by Gary Chezem "I changed NATO's SOPs to Relocate After Receiving Indirect Fire Losses, which I thought was the chief danger\. It was previously set on Relocate After Any Losses, which would cause good defensive positions to be abandoned\."

\- "__The First Dance__"\.  I made some changes to the narrative that Gary recommended to assist Players in understanding a feature within Tactical Transport which is not intuitive\. The revised scenario contains the change\. 

\- "__The Three Sisters__" updated by David Whitt to modify the Bradley SOPs to get them to engage more

\- "__FR1 Campaign__" with revised SOP and units placed in At Start locations by Charles\.

\- __Tutorials 7, 8 and 9__ have been finished by JohnO and are included here to start testing\.  He is keen to get helpful feedback and he has created his own feedback form in Word that I am putting in the \\Documents\\\_User
