# Welcome to _Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War_

This is a grand tactical combat simulation on the Cold War battlefield\. As the force Commander, you will plan and then issue orders and Standard Operating Procedures to your battalion, brigade, or regimental forces shaping the fight by maneuver and your intent\. Your forces will engage the enemy on rendered real\-world map locations\. Each hex is 500m of militarily significant terrain\. Each battle can last 4 to 24 hours of in\-game time\. Your troops will meet their foes any time of day and in any environment\. 

The game engine is based on asynchronous WEGO turns\. This means you will issue orders and then watch a variable amount of time unfold on the battlefield\. Then issue or adjust orders to react to what has happened as you execute your battleplan\. 

__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__ is a deep simulation of combat operations where your forces are arranged in maneuver units of companies, platoons, and sections of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry squads and teams, recon forces, engineers, air\-defense and anti\-tank systems, helicopters and more\. As the Commander, you must use available off\-map assets like long\-range artillery, rockets, or airstrikes\. 

Your efforts in this complex battlespace will be constantly challenged by modeled features like Electronic Warfare, Air Superiority, Realistic Weather, Line of Sight and Fire, Terrain and Elevation, Smoke and Mines, and Human Factors like training, morale, and readiness\. All these elements must be considered if you are to be victorious on the battlefield\. 

The game is packed with information dialogs, map overlays, and range rings to aid you as Commander, master the situation, and understand your forceâ€™s capabilities\.

__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__ is a data\-rich simulation where each nation has information on National Characteristics, Command Parameters, and Orders of Battle\.

As a toolkit, you can create your own scenarios and campaigns\. You can also dive deeper and create or modify game data, artwork, and sound effects as you see fit\. All these modding capabilities are supported by detailed documentation\.
