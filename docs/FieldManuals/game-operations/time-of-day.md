# Time of Day

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__ deals with four different times of the day\. Dusk and dawn occur at the times of day appropriate to the region for the month of the year of the scenario\. 

During the game when a time\-of\-day changes, a popup dialog will show with the relevant information for the change\. Also, during the game, depending on the time of day, the weather panel and map will have distinct changes in color to show the various times of day\.

## Dawn

Dawn occurs roughly 90 minutes before sunrise\. During this time there is a thermal inversion of surface temperatures that degrades thermal sight detection ranges and the accuracy of optically guided weapons\. The map will show a gradually disappearing nightshade as the sun rises\. Illumination will also increase as the sun comes up\.

## Day 

Day is the time between sunrise and sunset when the maximum possible visibility occurs\. The map is shown free of any color adjustment during the day\.

## Dusk 

Dusk occurs roughly 90 minutes after sunset\. During this time there is a thermal inversion of surface temperatures that degrades thermal sights and optically guided weapons\. The map will show a gradual darkening as the sun sets \(orange to dark\)\. Illumination will also decrease as the sun goes down\.

## Night

Night is the time from after sunset until sunrise\. The maximum visibility is determined by the level of illumination based on the phase of the moon\. Night operation of aircraft may be impacted if those aircraft are not capable of night operations\.

__NOTE__: While visibility may be extensive in distance, objects cannot be seen visually without having illumination or using sensors that work without light \(Thermal, Radar, IR systems\)\.
