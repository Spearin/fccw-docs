# Game Launch and User Interface

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


This section will cover the basics of launching a scenario and the basics of the new User Interface \(UI\) in the game\.

## Scenario Start\-Up

Once you have selected a scenario to play by one of the means noted earlier, you will get a screen where you will wait for a few seconds \(or more on slower computers or larger scenarios\) for the game to load the map and data\.

Once that is complete, you will get the main game screen, as seen below\.

## Setting Up the UI

Before we dive into the details of all the various User Interface \(UI\) elements, there are a few new capabilities for how you can set up the UI to suit your taste\.

- All the dialogs and panels that are shown, except for the Main Menu Bar at the top of the screen and the Status Bar at the bottom of the screen can be moved around on the screen or onto other screens\. 
- > **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

Dialogs and Panels with this symbol in the lower right can be resized\. Most have a minimum and maximum size\.
- > **Note**: Image omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.

Dialogs and Panels with this symbol in the upper right can be collapsed to the title bar or expanded to full size\. Useful if you want to see more of the screen\.
- A few of the Staff Dialogs have active maps that will update with information as the game is played\. 
- Most of the dialogs and panels will remember the last location they were placed on the screen and will be in those positions the next time you play a scenario\.
- The Dashboard can be locked to display information on one unit, and more dashboards can be opened\. The dashboard can also collapse to a smaller size if you need it, and they also will dock against each other\.
- The UI should work well with ultra\-wide screens and scale well with 4K monitors\.
!!! note

    __ If you have multiple monitors with different font scaling levels and drag dialogs to another screen with a different scale, the dialogs and other menu panels may not display correctly\. This is something we are looking into and hope to correct in the future\.
