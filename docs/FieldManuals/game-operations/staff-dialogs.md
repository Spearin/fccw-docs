# Staff Dialogs

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


One of the areas in the game that has had a massive increase in information for the player is Staff Reports\. 

These reports cover all aspects of your virtual Command Staff and should be used to help formulate your battle plan and to keep tabs on various aspects of your force, and the battle as the scenario unfolds\.

These reports can be accessed from the Staff Main Menu item at the top of the screen \(see Section 11 above\) or from the speed buttons on the floating Commander Panel \(see Section 13\.2 above\)\.

At the bottom of most of the dialogs are buttons for Print and Close\.  

Print will open a Printer Dialog box and allow you to print out what is on the tab to your printer or other printout options if available\. The Close button will close the entire Staff Report\.
