# Start a New Campaign

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


A campaign is a sequence of scenarios from one nation’s perspective where the result of one scenario may influence the subsequent scenario\. The player will be able to carry over core forces from scenario to scenario\. This means that campaign scenarios might play out very differently from single scenarios because it is of vital importance to preserve your force as you try to win your part of the war\.

To start a new Campaign, click on the Campaign button in the Main Menu\.
