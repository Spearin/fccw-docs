# Specific Unit Roles

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


__*Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War*__* *has a vast array of unit types covering the major platforms \(vehicles, aircraft, helicopters, field guns, etc\.\) and squads of the Cold War\. The primary unit types are described below\.

How these units are used in battle, and more information about their systems and sensors can be found in Battlefield Primer FM FCCW\-02\.
!!! note

    __ Roles can be changed in the game and impact how the AI tries to use the units\. Recce units will try to be out front locating the enemy\. Following that are the Main Effort \(mainly armor\) and Line \(mainly mechanized/infantry units\. Just behind those or mixed with are Overwatch units \(Defense and dedicated Anti\-tank units\)\. Finally, units in a Support role \(mainly Headquarters and Artillery units\) should stay at the rear of the force\.


## Recce Role

Recce \(Recon or Reconnaissance\) units are ideal scouts and should be used to find enemy units and to build a picture of how and where the enemy is attacking\. Reconnaissance units can safely operate outside the command range with no penalties \(they are trained to do this\) and often have better equipment and sensors to spot enemy troops\. Most of them are also harder to spot, but the downside of these units is \(in most cases\) that they are only lightly armed and armored\. 

Recon units are, in most cases, not meant to stop enemy line forces, but to locate them for you to plan how to deal with them with your line and other forces like artillery\. It is also critical as a commander to find and eliminate enemy recon units and deny them the ability to find and attack you\.

## Main Effort and Line Roles

Units with tank, infantry, or mechanized infantry subunits are defined as “Main Effort” or “Line” units\. Main Effort units are those tasked with taking ground and objectives and are usually tank\-based units\. Line units are the second line of attacking units and are generally the mechanized parts of the force\. These unit types make up most of the player’s combat force\. Line units can be divided into three types: Infantry, Mechanized \(armored fighting vehicles and infantry\), and Tanks\. The specific capabilities of these units may vary, but in general, these are their uses in battle: 

- __Infantry__ – These units are weak in the open and often in need of support, but when well\-hidden and armed with specialized weapons like ATGMs, they pose a severe threat to any unit out there\. 
- __Mechanized __– These units are quick, but often only lightly armored and should not be expected to hold their ground in the open against enemy tanks\. Depending on the armaments of the unit, however, they can seriously damage enemy infantry and armor\. 
- __Tanks__ – Tanks are the best units to kill the enemy’s tanks and other armored fighting vehicles at range\. Tanks have the toughest armor protection of any platform in the game and large cannons able to destroy enemy tanks at ranges over 2000 meters\.

Tanks are high\-value assets, so don’t throw them away recklessly in battle\.

## Overwatch Role

Units in the Overwatch role are used to provide some form of defense for the units in the Main Effort or Line groups\. These units usually follow behind the Main Effort and Line forces as units move and they sit ahead of any support units in the rear\. The capabilities of these units vary, but in general, these are their uses in battle: 

- __Anti\-Tank \(AT\)__ – These units are weak in the open, but when well\-hidden pose a serious threat to any unit out there\. These weapons are mainly used to kill tanks but can also take out infantry fighting vehicles\. Weapons used can be ATGMs, tank guns, recoilless rifles, and other anti\-armor systems\. 
- __Air Defense \(AD\) __– These units specialize in finding and destroying aerial threats over the battlefield\. These units need a good line of sight in and around the rest of your forces and should be used to keep them protected from enemy helicopters and aircraft\. These systems can be gun or missile\-based and usually have air search radar or other optical sensors to find and track air threats\. 
- __Artillery__ – In some cases, self\-propelled artillery units with short ranges like mortars can be in an overwatch role if they provide fires for main effort/line units that they are part of the formation with\.

## Support Role 

Units in the Support Role provide a variety of functions for the rest of the force\. These functions are as follows:

- __Headquarters__ \- Headquarters units are the command network of your forces\. These units are the ones that draw up plans and issue orders to their subordinate forces or relay orders to other forces\. Keeping these units alive and in command range of their subordinates will have a significant impact on your force’s ability to fight and win battles\. Most upper\-level headquarters are full of troops, trucks, and command vehicles and not meant to fight toe\-to\-toe with enemy units\.

Lower\-level headquarters for companies and platoons usually have the same type of units as those they command, like tanks, and can lend firepower during a battle\. Headquarters have some of the following abilities:

- Each order sent out to a unit and each situation report back from a unit is a “radio event”\. Excessive use of the radio can reveal a unit’s location and it will be shown on the map in a ‘detected’ spotted state if it is not detected already\. If the unit is an HQ and the enemy staff are enabled to give FSCC missions, then a high\-priority fire request against the HQ will be entered into the enemy FSCC mission queue\. The bottom line, move your HQs on occasion if order traffic is high or risk getting them shelled\. 
- If an HQ unit is destroyed, then another unit will be promoted to fill its spot in the chain of command\. This is called HQ subordination\. Any unit that has subordinate units is a de\-facto headquarters unit, whether it is officially described as such or not\. This state is not dependent on having HQ vehicles as subunits\. 
- The Chain of Command chart on the Map Page will show what the unit hierarchies currently are\. The highest HQ \(marked with “HQ” as its unit icon\) is in the overall command\. Depending on the situation there may be intermediate level HQs as well\. 
- HQ units can indirectly sight any enemy unit that its subordinate units have sighted\. The highest HQ sights everything that any friendly unit has sighted\. This is important for generating FSCC requests and reflecting passing sightings of the enemy up the command chain\. 
- Involuntary Movement: When a unit is forced to retreat it will move in the direction of immediate safety, or if there is none, towards its parent HQ\.
- __Engineering__ – Engineering units are used to do specific tasks such as laying a bridge over a stream or river, clearing mines and obstacles, and blowing bridges to deny their use to the enemy\. One of the significant changes from the earlier version of the game is the use of dedicated engineering assets on the map to do those functions listed above\. This includes information reports dedicated to engineering assets and activities\.

Currently supported in the game are dedicated short\-span bridging units and engineering troops\. The bridges are used to cross water obstacles and the engineering troops do all the other functions\. These units usually travel in the rear of the forces and then move up to do specific tasks\. These are not combat\-capable units and should not be placed into combat with the enemy\.

- __Artillery __– Artillery is the King of Battle\. These weapon systems represent guns, rockets, and mortars that can reach tens if not hundreds of kilometers into enemy territory and deliver several different types of munitions on targets with devastating effect\. These assets can also be on or off\-map depending on the scenario design\. Several reports and information panels such as the Fire Support panel provide details on these units and allow you to see what they are doing and access to order them to fire on targets of your choosing\. There is also an option to have these assets placed under FSCC \(Fire Support Control Center\) control which will use the AI to direct their fires on spotted enemy units\. When these units are on the map, they should be placed behind your forces but in range of the enemy to be able to fire on them\. Artillery units can, when pressed and capable \(noted as direct fire capable and carrying the right ammunition\), engage in direct fire against attacking units\. Artillery units both on and off\-map can be subjected to enemy counter\-battery fire\. This is returned enemy artillery fire based on locating your firing batteries via counter\-battery radars and other means\. It would be best if you got in the habit of shooting and then moving to avoid losses\.
- __On\-Map Air Support \- __Various types of helicopters are included in the game\. There are Attack, Recon, and Utility versions of Helicopters\. Helicopters can carry a variety of weapons geared to anti\-armor or anti\-personnel missions, but they can also be assigned to perform reconnaissance tasks\. In future updates, we will add the utility/transport helicopters for airborne assault operations\. Helicopters are just like any other on\-map unit except for the following differences:
- They ignore all terrain costs when moving\.
- They move much faster than the ground units based on their cruise speed and flight profile\.
- Depending on movement orders, helicopters will fly Nap of the Earth \(NOE\) using terrain to screen and cover their movements when Hunting \(a helicopter\-specific order for moving and attacking enemy targets\) or doing a Deliberate Move\. They will fly at low altitude if executing a hasty move\.
- They do not count against stacking limits in the location they occupy\.
- They do not suffer NBC \(Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological\) attacks if they move through a contaminated hex location\.
- They do not suffer minefield attacks if they move through a mined location\.
- Unit Posture – Helicopter units cannot dig in or fortify\.
- Helicopters with mast\-mounted sensors receive a bonus to spot and a bonus not to get spotted when looking for enemy units\.
- To resupply, helicopters must fly back and land at a FARP \(Forward Arming and Refueling Point\) unit\. If the FARP is missing, then the units will go to the current highest HQ on the map to resupply\.
- __Off\-Map Air Support \- __Off\-Map Air support is units of propeller or jet\-powered aircraft with various missions designed to strike targets on the battlefield\. All aircraft are held off\-map, in particular, loiter areas for commitment to air strikes under the player’s direction or FSCC control\. When the air strike is complete the surviving aircraft either return to base to rearm if out of ammunition or go back on station if weapons are still available\. After rearming they will return to the loiter area to await future assignments\. The doctrine generally allows for a certain number of fixed\-wing air close air support sorties within 40 km or so of the Forward Edge of the Battle Area \(FEBA\)\. Since the FEBA is an extremely high\-risk area for these valuable assets, availability will be limited, and strikes should be reserved for high\-value targets\. Long\-range artillery and helicopter assets remain the preferred platforms for routine fire missions within this zone\. Off\-map strike aircraft have the following capabilities:
- Aircraft that are rated All\-Weather can fly anytime visibility is 500 meters or better \(in rain/snow\)\. Non\-All\-Weather aircraft are grounded if the weather is poor\. 
- Aircraft that are rated for Night Operations can fly normally at night\. Those units without this rating are grounded and cannot fly at night\.
- Close Air Support \(CAS\) aircraft are equipped to strike ground targets\.
- Level Bombers fly high over the battlefield and drop weapons against ground targets\.
- SEAD \(Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses\) aircraft are equipped with special anti\-radiation missiles \(ARMs\) that seek out and destroy air search radars rendering Surface to Air systems \(SAMs\) useless\. They do not affect optical and infrared \(IR\) systems\.
- Most scenarios will have a limited number of air strikes \(if any\) and those assets will be available for a limited amount of time\.
