> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


PBEM\+\+ is a more advanced and user\-friendly way to do the standard PBEM game\. In this case, the games are sent back and forth via servers at Slitherine Games automatically as you finish turns and send them\. The game file resides on the Slitherine server, so you can technically log in to your account from any computer and pick up and play your games with your friends\.

## Register New PBEM\+\+ Account

If you would like to create a new Matrix/Slitherine PBEM\+\+ account, you can select the Register New Account option and then fill in your User ID \(alphanumeric with no spaces\), a Password \(something you will remember\), and a valid email address\.

When all that is complete, you can click on the Register button\. It may take a few moments to send the information to the servers\. If everything works out, you will be presented with the PBEM\+\+ Game Lobby\.

The top window will show all available challenges\. The information displayed includes the Scenario name, the Side you will play in the game, the Type of game, which the Challenger is, and the date the challenge was issued\. 

The type can be one of two choices\. The first is Public\. Anyone can accept a public challenge and play the game\. The second type is Private\. Private challenges are those created by a player with a password\. To accept the challenge, you need to know the password\. These types of challenges are usually between friends and are set up, so the other player knows the password\.

Once you select a challenge and click on the Accept button, you are given a chance to send a message to your opponent before the action starts\.
