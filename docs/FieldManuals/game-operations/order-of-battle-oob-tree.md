# Order of Battle \(OOB\) Tree

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


One important function of the Spotlight Panel \(F10\) is the Order of Battle Tree\. The OOB tree provides a listing of all your units and shows which units report to \(are subordinate to\) which headquarters\. This information is vital as command delays and resupply capability are tied to a unit’s distance from its local/primary headquarters\.

In some cases, you as the commander may want to move units under another command or change up the composition of a formation to better suit the mission at hand\. There are two functions to help with the arrangement of units\. Resubordinate and Reorder\. They are described below\.

## Unit Resubordinate

To move a unit from one command to another you need to click on the unit to move, in this case __3/D/1\-69 Ar__, and then drag the unit out and up to the new HQ you want it to be a part of and release the mouse button\. In this case, we are subordinating it to __HQ B/1\-15 Mech__\. After releasing the button, the units should appear at the bottom of the new HQ’s formation as seen in the right image\.

Once a unit is attached to a new HQ, it will use that HQ for communication and resupply based on the new HQ’s command ranges\. Adding more units to a new HQ also increases the amount of generated radio traffic and adds to the chance of the enemy locating that HQ\.

## Unit Reorder

Once you resubordinate a unit into a new command, you may wish to move it into a different place in the subordinate order\. Using the Reorder function can make those changes\.

At the bottom of the Spotlight Panel, check the Reorder function\. Then click and drag the unit you want to move and release it on the unit you want to be above\.
