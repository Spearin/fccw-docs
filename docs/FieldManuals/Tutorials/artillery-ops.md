!!! note

    __In Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War, artillery units from NATO and the Warsaw Pact may look different and have different names, but they work the same way in the game\. You’ll use the same steps to call in fire missions, move artillery units, and keep them supplied—no matter which side you play\. Focus on learning how to use artillery effectively, and you’ll be successful with any faction\.


__*Flashpoint Campaigns Cold War*__ features a robust artillery system that allows players to provide indirect fire support to friendly forces\. 

Artillery operations are crucial for suppressing enemy positions, disrupting enemy movement, and providing force multipliers in offensive and defensive scenarios\.

This tutorial focuses on Artillery Operations, covering the planning, execution, and coordination of indirect fire support\.

## What are Artillery Operations?

Artillery Operations involve using long\-range fire support assets, such as self\-propelled or towed artillery, to engage enemy forces at a distance\. Artillery units provide fire missions ranging from direct fire support to suppression and counter\-battery strikes\.

### Key Features of Artillery Operations

1. Artillery Targeting and Fire Missions:
    - Players can designate fire missions for artillery units via the Artillery Planner UI\.
    - Artillery units can conduct various fire missions, including:
    - Suppression Fire: Disrupts enemy forces by lowering their combat effectiveness\.
    - Counter\-Battery Fire: Targets enemy artillery positions using counter\-battery radar data to detect and engage enemy artillery units\.
    - Pre\-planned strikes: Conducted before or during engagements to weaken enemy positions\.
2. Execution of Artillery Strikes:
    - Once a fire mission is assigned, artillery units will engage in the designated area\.
    - The effectiveness of artillery strikes depends on range, weather, terrain, and unit experience\.
    - Spotting units can improve accuracy by providing real\-time targeting data\.
3. Resupply and Positioning:
    - Artillery units require ammunition resupply over time to maintain operational effectiveness\.
    - Players should relocate artillery after firing to avoid counter\-battery fire from the enemy\.
    - Artillery should be positioned in protected areas while maintaining effective range\.
4. Post\-Mission Considerations:
    - Artillery must be rearmed and repositioned to continue supporting the battle\.
    - Coordination with air and ground forces maximizes the effectiveness of indirect fire support\.
    - Well\-planned artillery operations can disrupt enemy formations, break up assaults, and support friendly advances\.
By mastering Artillery Operations, players can gain a tactical advantage by delivering devastating long\-range firepower, shaping the battlefield before direct engagements occur\.

## Artillery Units and Vehicles

In this tutorial, we’ll explore the artillery platforms\. To access the following information, highlight the unit and open the Dashboard \(F4\) and the Subunit Inspector \(F6\)\.

### Artillery

Artillery units provide critical fire support to maneuver forces, suppress enemy positions, and shape the battlefield\. Understanding the types of artillery units and their primary vehicles is essential for practical integration into your tactical plans\.

Using artillery units and vehicles requires careful planning, positioning, and integration with forward observation teams to maximize combat effectiveness and minimize the risk of friendly fire\.

#### Roles in Combat for Artillery

1. Fire Support for Maneuver Units
    - Suppressing or destroying enemy forces to support infantry and armor advances\.
    - Providing barrage fire to weaken defenses before assaults\.
2. Counter\-Battery Operations
    - Targeting and destroying enemy artillery, mortars, and rocket launchers\.
3. Area Denial & Interdiction
    - Saturating areas with artillery to block enemy movements\.
    - Striking supply lines, command posts, and critical infrastructure\.
4. Psychological Impact
    - "Shock and awe" tactics involve using overwhelming firepower to demoralize the enemy\.
#### Types of Artillery

##### Self\-Propelled Artillery \(SPA\)

- Mobile fire support that can relocate quickly after firing\.
- Often feature automated loading systems for sustained barrages\.
- Example units:
- M109A3 Paladin – NATO standard self\-propelled 155mm howitzer\.
- 2S1 Gvozdika – Soviet 122mm self\-propelled howitzer\.

##### Towed Artillery

- Requires transport vehicles for movement but offers excellent range and firepower\.
- Best suited for defensive and pre\-planned fire missions\.
- Example units:
- M198 155mm Howitzer – US Army/Marine Corps towed artillery\.
- D\-30 122mm Howitzer – Standard Soviet/Russian divisional artillery piece\.

##### Rocket Artillery

- Provides large\-area saturation fire and rapid\-response capability\.
- Less accurate than tube artillery but devastating against massed formations\.
- Example units:
- M270 MLRS – NATO multiple\-launch rocket system capable of firing guided or unguided rockets\.
- BM\-21 Grad – Soviet 122mm multiple launch rocket system\.

##### Mortars

- Short\-range, high\-angle fire support is ideal for urban and mountainous terrain\.
- Rapid deployment with lightweight mobile platforms\.
- Example units:
- M120 120mm Mortar – US heavy mortar for indirect support\.
- 2B11 Sani 120mm Mortar – Soviet standard battalion\-level mortar\.

## __Types of Ammunition__

In Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War, each combat unit employs specific types of ammunition based on its role and weapon system\. Understanding and leveraging the right ammunition type is critical to maximizing battlefield effectiveness and achieving mission success\.

Nuclear rounds are not delivered by conventional artillery\. Instead, they are assigned to strategic missile systems outside the direct control of artillery units\. These weapons are scenario\-dependent and represent the highest level of escalation, intended only for specific mission conditions or narrative purposes\.

### High Explosive \(HE\)

- The area becomes safer quickly than with persistent agents\.
- Used for tactical effects without long\-term contamination\.

### Persistent Chemical \(PCHEM\)

- Uses agents like VX or mustard gas \(HD\)\.
- Contaminates areas for extended periods\.
- Intended for area denial\.

### Smoke – Visually Blocking \(SMKN\)

- Produces thick smoke to obscure movement or observation\.
- Common fillers include White Phosphorus or Hexachloroethane\.

### High Explosive – Base Bleed \(HE\)

- Equipped with base\-bleed unit to reduce drag\.
- Extends range without rocket propulsion\.
- Retains more explosive filler than rocket\-assisted types\.

### High Explosive – Rocket Assisted Projectile \(HE\)

- Rocket\-assisted to increase range\.
- Reduces explosive payload to accommodate the propulsion system\.

### Illumination – Visible \(ILL\)
