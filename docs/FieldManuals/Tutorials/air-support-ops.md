# Air Support  Operations

> **Note**: Images omitted — refer to original DOCX for figures.


*"Whoever controls the air generally controls the battlefield\."* – General Dwight D\. Eisenhower\.  


__*Flashpoint Campaigns Cold War*__ allow players to integrate Air Support Operations, utilizing a variety of aircraft for close air support \(CAS\), suppression of enemy air defenses \(SEAD\), aerial reconnaissance and surveillance \(ARS\), level bombing, utility missions, and gunship strikes\. Proper air asset coordination can tip the battle balance by neutralizing high\-value targets, suppressing enemy movements, delivering precise firepower, supporting logistical operations, and providing critical battlefield intelligence\.

    _


In reality, NATO and the Warsaw Pact employed different aircraft and munitions; however, in\-game air support followed the same mechanics for both sides\. Whether calling in a Soviet Su\-25 or an American A\-10, players will assign air missions, designate targets, and manage air assets using the same interface and rules\.

This tutorial will only cover CAS, SEAD, Gunships, and Level bombers; utility aircraft will be covered in a future update\.

This tutorial covers Air Support Operations, detailing how to request, coordinate, and maximize the effectiveness of airpower\.

## What are Air Support Operations?

Air Support Operations involve deploying fixed\-wing and rotary\-wing aircraft to support ground forces\. These missions may include close air support, deep strikes, interdiction, and reconnaissance\.

###  Key Features of Air Support Operations:

1. Air Mission Planning:
    - Players can request air support via the Air Support Planner UI\.
    - Fixed\-wing aircraft missions include:
    - Close Air Support \(CAS\): Engages enemy forces near friendly troops\.
    - Interdiction: Targets enemy reinforcements and supply lines\.
    - Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses \(SEAD\): Destroying or neutralizing enemy surface\-to\-air missile \(SAM\) sites and anti\-aircraft artillery \(AAA\)\.
    - Reconnaissance: Provides critical intelligence on enemy movements\.
!!! note

    __ Air Assault and Transport will be covered in Section 13, Tutorial 10: Air Assault Operations\.


1. Execution of Air Support Missions:
    - Once assigned, aircraft will proceed to their designated target area\.
    - CAS missions require forward observers or spotters to improve accuracy\.
    - Enemy air defenses pose a risk to aircraft, so SEAD \(Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses\) missions may be necessary\.
2. Air Support Limitations:
    - Air assets have limited availability and must be carefully assigned\.
    - Weather conditions and airspace control impact mission effectiveness\.
    - Aircraft must return to bases for rearming and refueling\.
3. Post\-Mission Adjustments:
    - Players should analyze airstrike effectiveness and adjust future missions accordingly\.
    - Air superiority is vital to ensuring uncontested air support operations\.
    - Proper integration of air and ground forces enhances battlefield success\.
By mastering Air Support Operations, players can exploit airpower’s mobility and striking power, creating opportunities for ground forces to advance and dominate the battlefield\.

## Air Support Units

Let’s examine the types of platforms in this scenario\. Then, access the information below using the Dashboard \(F4 hotkey\) and Subunit Inspector \(F6 hotkey\)\.

### Close Air Support \(CAS\)

Close Air Support \(CAS\) involves ground\-attack aircraft with various ammunitions designed to engage and destroy ground targets\. As the commander, you or the Fire Support Coordination Center \(FSCC\) can call in these assets from off\-map holding areas\. CAS is fast and lethal but remains vulnerable to enemy air defenses\.

#### Types of CAS Aircraft

- __NATO:__
- A\-10A Thunderbolt II – iconic CAS platform, durable, tank\-killer\.
- F\-4E Phantom II – multi\-role, used for CAS in some NATO forces\.
- Harrier GR\.3 or AV\-8A/B \(USMC/UK\) – V/STOL CAS option \(terrain flexibility\)\.
- __Warsaw Pact:__
- Su\-25 Frogfoot – Soviet A\-10 equivalent, heavily armored\.
- MiG\-21bis or MiG\-23BN – secondary CAS roles in Eastern Bloc air forces\.

### Interdiction/Strike Aircraft

Interdiction/Strike aircraft are military aircraft designed to conduct precision strikes against enemy ground targets, primarily to disrupt, delay, or destroy enemy forces before they can reach the battlefield\. These missions typically target supply routes, bridges, convoys, command centers, and other critical infrastructure to impede enemy operations\. Interdiction can occur deep behind enemy lines \(deep interdiction\) or closer to the frontline \(battlefield interdiction\)\.

#### Types of Interdiction/Strike Aircraft

- __NATO:__
- F\-111F Aardvark \- Deep strike, interdiction, precision bombing
- F\-15E Strike Eagle \(Introduced in 1988\) \- Multi\-role, interdiction, strike
- B\-52G Stratofortress \- Strategic bombing, deep strike, interdiction
- __Warsaw Pact:__
- Su\-24 Fencer \- Deep strike, interdiction, tactical bombing
- MiG\-27 Flogger\-D/J \- Tactical strike, ground attack
- Tu\-22M Backfire \- Long\-range strike, maritime interdiction

### Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses \(SEAD\) 

__Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses \(SEAD\)__ refers to military operations designed to neutralize, destroy, or temporarily degrade enemy air defense systems, including surface\-to\-air missiles \(SAMs\), anti\-aircraft artillery \(AAA\), and associated radar installations\. 

The primary goal of SEAD is to reduce the threat posed by these defenses, enabling friendly aircraft to operate more freely in contested airspace\. 

SEAD missions can involve a combination of electronic warfare \(jamming and deception\), precision\-guided munitions, and direct attacks by aircraft, artillery, or missiles\.

#### Types of Suppression Enemy Air Defense \(SEAD\) Aircraft

- __NATO__
- F\-4E Wild Weasel__ \- __Detect, engage, and neutralize enemy radar\-guided SAM sites and air defense systems\.
- __Warsaw Pact__
- MiG\-25BM Foxbat \- Destroy enemy radar systems and SAM sites using long\-range anti\-radiation missiles
- Su\-17M4 Fitter\-K \- Ground attack and SEAD platform 

### Gunships

__Gunships__ are heavily armed military aircraft equipped with various types of weapons, such as machine guns, autocannons, rockets, and missiles\. Its primary roles include close air support \(CAS\), ground attack, armed reconnaissance, and troop escort\. Gunships are typically modified cargo aircraft, helicopters, or purpose\-built attack platforms designed to deliver sustained firepower against ground targets\. Examples include the AC\-130 Spectre, AH\-1 Cobra, and Mi\-24 Hind\.

#### Types of Gunships

- __NATO__
- AC\-130H Spectre \- Close Air Support \(CAS\), armed reconnaissance, ground attack\.
- AC\-130A/E Spectre \- CAS, night interdiction, armed reconnaissance\.
- AH\-1 Cobra \- Attack helicopter used for CAS and anti\-armor operations\.
- AH\-64A Apache \- Attack helicopter focused on anti\-armor, CAS, and armed reconnaissance\.
- __Warsaw Pact__
- Mi\-24D/Hind\-D \- Attack helicopter, armed transport, CAS\.
- Mi\-24P/Hind\-F \- Attack helicopter, CAS, and transport\.
- Mi\-8TV Hip \- Armed transport, CAS, and troop insertion\.
- Mi\-28 Havoc \- Dedicated attack helicopter, anti\-armor, and CAS\.
