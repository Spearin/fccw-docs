As the force Commander, you will plan and then issue orders and Standard Operating Procedures to your battalion, brigade, or regimental forces shaping the fight by maneuver and your intent. Your forces will engage the enemy on rendered real-world map locations. Each hex is 500m of militarily significant terrain. Each battle can last 4 to 24 hours of in-game time. Your troops will meet their foes any time of day and in any environment. </p> <p>The game engine is based on asynchronous WEGO turns. This means you will issue orders and then watch a variable amount of time unfold on the battlefield. Then issue or adjust orders to react to what has happened as you execute your battleplan. </p> <p>Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War is a deep simulation of combat operations where your forces are arranged in maneuver units of companies, platoons, and sections of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry squads and teams, recon forces, engineers, air-defense and anti-tank systems, helicopters and more. As the Commander, you must use available off-map assets like long-range artillery, rockets, or airstrikes. </p> <p>Your efforts in this complex battlespace will be constantly challenged by modeled features like Electronic Warfare, Air Superiority, Realistic Weather, Line of Sight and Fire, Terrain and Elevation, Smoke and Mines, and Human Factors like training, morale, and readiness. All these elements must be considered if you are to be victorious on the battlefield. </p> <p>The game is packed with information dialogs, map overlays, and range rings to aid you as Commander, master the situation, and understand your force\u2019s capabilities.</p> <p>Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War is a data-rich simulation where each nation has information on National Characteristics, Command Parameters, and Orders of Battle. Data Tables are packed with era-specific equipment and troops. Weapon Systems of the time, such as guns, missiles, precision munitions, small arms, and much more, are comprehensively modeled. </p> <p>As a toolkit, you can create your own scenarios and campaigns. You can also dive deeper and create or modify game data, artwork, and sound effects as you see fit. All these modding capabilities are supported by detailed documentation.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#gender-pronouns-and-inclusion","title":"Gender Pronouns and Inclusion","text":"<p>We understand that users of all genders will play our simulation.

It is assumed that the units are smart enough to show a frontal aspect if the enemy is detected. If caught by surprise, a target unit at range may have some subunits get hit in the flank as they are not in a defensible position. At a range of one hex, there is an increased chance of getting a flank attack on a target unit as some of the subunits are assumed to be close enough and, in a position, where flank shots are possible. If both the attacker and defender are in hex, attacks have a better chance to be flank or rear aspect shots as cover and spacing allow for more advantageous engagements. Infantry attacking armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) in built-up terrain (cities and forests) have a bonus to these better aspect shots.</p>"},{"location":"FCCW/FieldManuals/game-operations/combat-operations.html#direct-fires","title":"Direct Fires","text":"<p>All combat occurs during the turn resolution phase. Spotting is checked for all units and then each unit with Assault, Hold, Screen, Move-Deliberate, Move-Hasty, or Direct Support orders looks for suitable targets among the enemy units that it can sight directly or indirectly in some cases. A combat event for each pairing of attacker and defender is created and entered in the main game event queue. </p> <p>The combat event is resolved between the two units at the subunit level. The attacking unit calculates the quality and quantity of fire that it can effectively protect against the defender given the number of subunits that it has, the armaments that they mount and their effectiveness versus the target subunit, the range to the target, armaments base accuracy, attacker orders, crew quality, suppression from incoming fire, multiple targets, and special bonuses such as advanced gun sights. </p> <p>This effective projection of fire is applied to the defending unit which will take losses about the quantity and intrinsic protection rating of its runners, defender orders, posture, usable terrain bonus, movement, stealth, range, and special bonuses such as armor (Chobham, advanced composite, laminated, or reactive). The defender is also penalized if he has not sighted the attacker - surprise is assumed for the first few shots - and if the range is one or less then there is a further penalty due to the assumption that more flanking shots are available when at such close range. </p> <p>The attacker uses up munitions by the round or burst used to engage the enemy and is marked as \u201cfiring\u201d. This \u201cfiring\u201d status makes it easier for other units to spot it during the turn. Attacking also reduces a unit\u2019s readiness by a small amount as the crew deals with the rigors of loading and firing weapons or scanning for targets. Units occasionally gain a boost to morale if they achieve kills without taking losses. </p> <p>Defending units can take losses because of combat. These losses are tracked to individual subunits. Readiness and morale will both be degraded in these cases. Morale can take a bigger hit if the HQ is out of range or if a friendly unit within 1000 meters is wiped out.</p> <p>Units are not mindless zombies that die to the last subunit. If losses in the unit are too great and readiness and morale are low, a unit will spontaneously give up its mission orders and try to retreat to a safer location by scooting.</p>"},{"location":"FCCW/FieldManuals/game-operations/combat-operations.html#indirect-fires-idf","title":"Indirect Fires (IDF)","text":"<p>Where direct fires have the shooter seeing the target, indirect fires rely on another unit to spot a target and provide targeting information for the indirect fire units to use to shoot with. The advantage of indirect fire is its much longer ranges and less exposure to direct combat.</p> <p>Indirect fires are guns, rockets, and mortars that fire munitions (or are munitions in the case of rockets) over the battlefield.</p> <p>These systems show up on the map as various explosion animations in the target hex based on the type of munitions used. In our earlier games, artillery fired in a piecemeal fashion with several rounds being resolved each turn they attacked. Now, each gun fires rounds, and the attack lasts over a duration as shells are fired until the mission is over. This means enemy units can move into and out of the hex(es) being attacked. In some cases, the fire will be adjusted to follow targets if they are under direct observation and there are timely communications with the observer and shooter.</p> <p>Artillery fire missions can be of a few types as noted below:</p> <p>Direct Fire \u2013 Some field gun-equipped artillery platforms can point themselves at an enemy and fire directly. The wisdom of this is highly debatable but it can be done. Interestingly, Soviet tactics put great store in this technique and 122mm and 152mm SP howitzer assets can be attached to their assault formations to use direct fire against targets. While it is certainly much quicker than trying to organize on-call fire the cost to the lightly protected artillery would be horrendous. They used this technique extensively in the second half of WW2 with the SU-76 (76mm guns mounted in light tank chassis) and the 2S1 and 2S3 vehicles are the Cold War inheritors of that tradition. All other force structures might want to consider this a measure of last resort.</p> <p>Pre-Plotted Fires \u2013 These fire missions represent pre-registered targets for the artillery units to shoot at the start of a battle. For the AI player, the artillery barrages need to be set up in the Scenario Editor to start right at the start of the battle. For the player, this kind of strike needs to be plotted in the Setup Phase before the start of the battle and will start falling right when the first turn is executed. </p> <p>Direct Support \u2013 These are artillery assets that are dedicated to supporting a selected unit or set of units. These assets will not take on fire support requests from other units or provide counter-battery fires and are ready to perform fire missions only for the enemy units spotted by the units placed in direct support. These missions usually have slightly shorter command delays than the General Support operations.</p> <p>General Support \u2013 These are artillery assets that will take requests for fire from any friendly unit on the map and process them based on target type, urgency, and availability via the FSCC. Standard command delays exist for this type of support.</p> <p>Counter Battery \u2013 These assets are set to fire on located enemy artillery units that are in the range of the counter-battery unit.

Fire support requests are discarded if the target is lost or too much time passes between the initial call and the unit being able to shoot. This is done so as not to waste ammunition shelling the empty ground. </p> <p>During turn resolution, the FSCC is called to match fire support requests to available air and artillery assets. To be \u201cavailable\u201d an artillery unit must have an On Call, Direct Support, or Counter Battery order and otherwise be ready to fire (i.e., not wiped out, not moving, not already assigned an FSCC mission, etc.) or be an On-Call aircraft. </p> <p>Other missions are served first by eligible artillery units with Direct Support orders, then by General Support units, and finally by units with counter-battery orders if they are available.</p> <p>Available air and artillery units are assigned to the mission until the requested weight of fire has been accumulated.

At that time, they will be available to service FSCC or player requests. If an artillery unit runs low or out of ammunition, it will go on a resupply order to replenish its stocks.

For game purposes, we assume a tactical nuclear capability of approximately a 10kt yield with a 2 km blast radius. Subunits will be eliminated based on distance from the blast center by their intrinsic protection rating, NBC rating, cover, and posture. Units also suffer massive losses in both readiness and morale even if they survive the blast and are automatically contaminated with radiation. Contamination can cause additional losses over time if not dealt with in a short time after the attack. All bridges, smoke clouds, minefields, and chemical contamination within the blast zone will be eliminated.</p> <p>The ground will be contaminated with two hexes from the blast center for the rest of the game. Units moving through the contaminated zones run the risk of additional losses and get contaminated. All helicopters within a 5 km radius will be eliminated by the blast\u2019s shock wave. To decontaminate units, they must enter a Resupply order and spend time being cleared of the hazard.</p> <p>Persistent Chemical Weapons - A persistent chemical strike consists of various nerve or blood agents that can quickly incapacitate or kill exposed troops. Units caught in a persistent chemical attack can suffer losses based on their NBC rating take a considerable loss of readiness while getting into protective gear (MOPP suits) and suffer additional morale loss from the attack. Persistent chemical strikes leave markers on the map for the rest of the game. Any units moving through are attacked and contaminated. Like nuclear contamination, chemical contamination can be removed by a resupply order. Contaminated units fight with reduced combat effectiveness caused by the protective gear.</p> <p>Non-Persistent Chemical Weapons - A non-persistent chemical strike consists of various nerve or blood agents that can quickly incapacitate or kill exposed troops. Units caught in a non-persistent chemical attack can suffer losses based on their NBC rating take a significant loss of readiness while getting into protective gear (MOPP suits) and suffer additional morale loss from the attack.

These functions are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Headquarters - Headquarters units are the command network of your forces. These units are the ones that draw up plans and issue orders to their subordinate forces or relay orders to other forces. Keeping these units alive and in command range of their subordinates will have a significant impact on your force\u2019s ability to fight and win battles. Most upper-level headquarters are full of troops, trucks, and command vehicles and not meant to fight toe-to-toe with enemy units.</li> </ul> <p>Lower-level headquarters for companies and platoons usually have the same type of units as those they command, like tanks, and can lend firepower during a battle. Headquarters have some of the following abilities:</p> <ul> <li>Each order sent out to a unit and each situation report back from a unit is a \u201cradio event\u201d. Excessive use of the radio can reveal a unit\u2019s location and it will be shown on the map in a \u2018detected\u2019 spotted state if it is not detected already. If the unit is an HQ and the enemy staff are enabled to give FSCC missions, then a high-priority fire request against the HQ will be entered into the enemy FSCC mission queue. The bottom line, move your HQs on occasion if order traffic is high or risk getting them shelled. </li> <li>If an HQ unit is destroyed, then another unit will be promoted to fill its spot in the chain of command. This is called HQ subordination. Any unit that has subordinate units is a de-facto headquarters unit, whether it is officially described as such or not. This state is not dependent on having HQ vehicles as subunits. </li> <li>The Chain of Command chart on the Map Page will show what the unit hierarchies currently are. The highest HQ (marked with \u201cHQ\u201d as its unit icon) is in the overall command. Depending on the situation there may be intermediate level HQs as well. </li> <li>HQ units can indirectly sight any enemy unit that its subordinate units have sighted. The highest HQ sights everything that any friendly unit has sighted. This is important for generating FSCC requests and reflecting passing sightings of the enemy up the command chain. </li> <li>Involuntary Movement: When a unit is forced to retreat it will move in the direction of immediate safety, or if there is none, towards its parent HQ.</li> <li>Engineering \u2013 Engineering units are used to do specific tasks such as laying a bridge over a stream or river, clearing mines and obstacles, and blowing bridges to deny their use to the enemy. One of the significant changes from the earlier version of the game is the use of dedicated engineering assets on the map to do those functions listed above. This includes information reports dedicated to engineering assets and activities.</li> </ul> <p>Currently supported in the game are dedicated short-span bridging units and engineering troops. The bridges are used to cross water obstacles and the engineering troops do all the other functions. These units usually travel in the rear of the forces and then move up to do specific tasks. These are not combat-capable units and should not be placed into combat with the enemy.</p> <ul> <li>Artillery \u2013 Artillery is the King of Battle. These weapon systems represent guns, rockets, and mortars that can reach tens if not hundreds of kilometers into enemy territory and deliver several different types of munitions on targets with devastating effect. These assets can also be on or off-map depending on the scenario design. Several reports and information panels such as the Fire Support panel provide details on these units and allow you to see what they are doing and access to order them to fire on targets of your choosing. There is also an option to have these assets placed under FSCC (Fire Support Control Center) control which will use the AI to direct their fires on spotted enemy units. When these units are on the map, they should be placed behind your forces but in range of the enemy to be able to fire on them. Artillery units can, when pressed and capable (noted as direct fire capable and carrying the right ammunition), engage in direct fire against attacking units. Artillery units both on and off-map can be subjected to enemy counter-battery fire. This is returned enemy artillery fire based on locating your firing batteries via counter-battery radars and other means. It would be best if you got in the habit of shooting and then moving to avoid losses.</li> <li>__On-Map Air Support - __Various types of helicopters are included in the game. There are Attack, Recon, and Utility versions of Helicopters. Helicopters can carry a variety of weapons geared to anti-armor or anti-personnel missions, but they can also be assigned to perform reconnaissance tasks. In future updates, we will add the utility/transport helicopters for airborne assault operations. Helicopters are just like any other on-map unit except for the following differences:</li> <li>They ignore all terrain costs when moving.</li> <li>They move much faster than the ground units based on their cruise speed and flight profile.</li> <li>Depending on movement orders, helicopters will fly Nap of the Earth (NOE) using terrain to screen and cover their movements when Hunting (a helicopter-specific order for moving and attacking enemy targets) or doing a Deliberate Move. They will fly at low altitude if executing a hasty move.</li> <li>They do not count against stacking limits in the location they occupy.</li> <li>They do not suffer NBC (Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological) attacks if they move through a contaminated hex location.</li> <li>They do not suffer minefield attacks if they move through a mined location.</li> <li>Unit Posture \u2013 Helicopter units cannot dig in or fortify.</li> <li>Helicopters with mast-mounted sensors receive a bonus to spot and a bonus not to get spotted when looking for enemy units.</li> <li>To resupply, helicopters must fly back and land at a FARP (Forward Arming and Refueling Point) unit. If the FARP is missing, then the units will go to the current highest HQ on the map to resupply.</li> <li>__Off-Map Air Support - __Off-Map Air support is units of propeller or jet-powered aircraft with various missions designed to strike targets on the battlefield. All aircraft are held off-map, in particular, loiter areas for commitment to air strikes under the player\u2019s direction or FSCC control. When the air strike is complete the surviving aircraft either return to base to rearm if out of ammunition or go back on station if weapons are still available. After rearming they will return to the loiter area to await future assignments. The doctrine generally allows for a certain number of fixed-wing air close air support sorties within 40 km or so of the Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA). Since the FEBA is an extremely high-risk area for these valuable assets, availability will be limited, and strikes should be reserved for high-value targets. Long-range artillery and helicopter assets remain the preferred platforms for routine fire missions within this zone. Off-map strike aircraft have the following capabilities:</li> <li>Aircraft that are rated All-Weather can fly anytime visibility is 500 meters or better (in rain/snow). Non-All-Weather aircraft are grounded if the weather is poor. </li> <li>Aircraft that are rated for Night Operations can fly normally at night. Those units without this rating are grounded and cannot fly at night.</li> <li>Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft are equipped to strike ground targets.</li> <li>Level Bombers fly high over the battlefield and drop weapons against ground targets.</li> <li>SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) aircraft are equipped with special anti-radiation missiles (ARMs) that seek out and destroy air search radars rendering Surface to Air systems (SAMs) useless. They do not affect optical and infrared (IR) systems.</li> <li>Most scenarios will have a limited number of air strikes (if any) and those assets will be available for a limited amount of time.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"FCCW/FieldManuals/game-operations/spotting-and-line-of-sight-los.html","title":"Spotting and Line of Sight (LOS)","text":""},{"location":"FCCW/FieldManuals/game-operations/spotting-and-line-of-sight-los.html#spotting-and-line-of-sight-los","title":"Spotting and Line of Sight (LOS)","text":"<p>Note: Images omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>The ability to detect, that is distinguish between a military platform and its surroundings is heavily impacted by illumination, especially when not equipped with excellent Thermal Imaging or Night Vision equipment.</p> <p>So, the gameplay panel gives you weather conditions and weather/meteorological visibility.

In this case, a tank is shown, so you may assume that the unit is predominantly composed of those types. Vehicles of all types, artillery, and aircraft are shown with vehicle graphics. Non-vehicular units use NATO symbolic graphics. Suppose the unit is composed of carrier vehicles and dismountable passengers. In that case, the vehicle Sil will be shown while the unit is moving, and the dominant passenger NATO Symbol will be shown.

These tags allow the player to more quickly identify where the unit belongs in the general organization of his forces. This information is shown only to the owning player and long tags are truncated to fit. </li> <li>Unit Status - To quickly show the combat effectiveness of a unit there is a symbol just below the unit\u2019s designation. </li> <li>Green Circle - Indicates the unit is combat effective and is in good order with ammo and readiness levels. </li> <li>Yellow Triangle - with the point up denotes a unit that is of marginal fighting capability. It has possibly taken some losses or is low on ammo, readiness, or morale and its combat abilities are reduced. </li> <li>Red Inverted Triangle - Indicates a unit with critical combat effectiveness conditions. It is deficient in ammo, readiness, or morale, and has taken significant losses or a combination of this effect. These units should be pulled out of combat for resupply as they are not very combat-effective in this state. </li> <li>Black Square \u2013 Indicates a unit has reached combat ineffectiveness and is no longer capable of practical combat action. These units are usually out of critical ammo, are very low on readiness, have shattered morale, or sustained heavy losses in several subunits.</li> <li>Unit Size - The three dots at the top center tell us the size of the unit, in this case, a platoon. The size indicators are \u201cX\u201d = brigade, \u201cIII\u201d = regiment, \u201cII\u201d = battalion, \u201cI\u201d = company (approx. 10 subunits), \u201c...\u201d = platoon (approx. 3-5 subunits), \u201c..\u201d section (1 or 2 subunits), and \u201c.\u2019 = an individual subunit. This information is shown only to the owning player. NOTE: For headquarters units, the unit size shown is the size of the command, not of the HQ unit itself. </li> <li>National Color \u2013 Every unit of a nation has a color-coded background for the unit counters. The Soviets are red, the Americans are green, and the French are blue. Each nation\u2019s background is unique and allows the players to tell the various forces apart.</li> <li>Is Headquarter Unit - The \u201cH\u201d in the upper right corner means that this unit is a headquarters unit. Some are formally organized to be headquarters, and some are just acting as such. In either case, an H will appear in this location. This information is shown only to the owning player. These units provide the chain of command and communications link to their subordinates.</li> <li>Active Emitter \u2013 If a unit is equipped with a Radar system, either Air Search or Ground Search and it is activated, an orange box will be displayed on the counter to show an active emitter.</li> <li>Unit Order - The white letter (\u201cM\u201d) in the lower right of the counter indicates the unit\u2019s current Order. Valid orders are the following: \u201cA\u201d = Assault, \u201cM\u201d = Move - Deliberate, \u201c2\u201d = Move - Hasty, \u201cS\u201d = Screen, \u201cH\u201d = Hold, \u201cB\u201d = Barrage, \u201cG\u201d for Gas Attack, \u201cC\u201d = Counter-Battery, \u201cE\u201d = Engineering Action, \u201cR\u201d = Resupply, \u201cO\u201d = On the call, \u201cF\u201d for Fallback (Scooting), \u201cW\u201d for Withdrawing, and \u201cZ\u201d for helicopters that are in Hunt mode. This information is shown only to the owning player. These orders will be explained in more detail in Section 21 below. </li> <li>Spotted Indicator - If the unit has been sighted by the enemy, then a tiny white dot will be drawn at the bottom of the counter to the left of the unit order. This is based on being lazed, shot at, or a reasonable estimation of \u201cwe see them so I bet they can see us\u201d for your units and spotting the enemy. NOTE: This indicator will only show if the option to Show Enemy Units is turned on.</li> <li> <p>Movement Direction and Type - If a unit is currently in motion, then a small triangle will be shown pointing in the direction that will be moved in next. If the triangle is black, the unit is utilizing road movement via a hasty move order and is going for speed over combat readiness. A blue triangle indicates a Deliberate Move order, and the unit is moving slower and will use both road and off-road movements to the objective while being ready for combat. A red triangle indicates a unit moving in an Assault order and is combat-ready. Assault movement is a bit faster than a deliberate trading cover for speed to close on an objective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Number of Active Runners - The large number in the bottom left corner is the number of subunits mission-capable (\u201c10\u201d in this example). A subunit is mission-capable (also known as a \u201crunner\u201d) if it is physically and psychologically able to carry out its orders. The other possible states are destroyed and fallen out. A tank that has thrown a track, a truck with a conked-out engine, or an infantry squad so shattered that it cannot rise from the bottom of its trench are examples of subunits that have fallen out. Fallen-out subunits count equally with destroyed subunits for victory purposes but can be recovered between scenarios in a campaign game. </p> </li> <li>Movement Class \u2013 The letter in the upper left of the counter indicates the unit\u2019s current movement type. These types are as follows: \u201cL\u201d = Leg, \u201cW\u201d = Wheeled, \u201cT\u201d = Tracked, \u201cR\u201d = Rotor, \u201cP\u201d = Propeller, \u201cJ\u201d = Jet, \u201cR\u201d = Rocket, \u201cS\u201d = Static (non-movable).</li> </ul> <p>NOTE: See Section 22.1.3 below for details on the Lost Transport Indicator.</p>"},{"location":"FCCW/FieldManuals/game-operations/user-preferences.html","title":"User Preferences","text":""},{"location":"FCCW/FieldManuals/game-operations/user-preferences.html#user-preferences","title":"User Preferences","text":"<p>Note: Images omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Clicking on the \u201cUser Preferences...\u201d button will open a dialog box with four tabs of settings information for various game functions.

It works pretty much like <code>slice</code>     just the other way round. It returns a list of lists with the     given number of items. If you provide a second parameter this     is used to fill up missing items. See this example.</p> capitalize function (s) <p>Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others     lowercase.</p> center function (value, width) <p>Centers the value in a field of a given width.</p> count builtin_function_or_method <p>Return the number of items in a container.</p> d function (value, default_value, boolean) <p>If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value,     otherwise the value of the variable.</p> default function (value, default_value, boolean) <p>If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value,     otherwise the value of the variable.</p> dictsort function (value, case_sensitive, by, reverse, sort_func) <p>Sort a dict and yield (key, value) pairs. Python dicts may not     be in the order you want to display them in, so sort them first.</p> e function (s) <p>Replace the characters <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>'</code>, and <code>\"</code> in     the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display     text that might contain such characters in HTML.</p> escape function (s) <p>Replace the characters <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>'</code>, and <code>\"</code> in     the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display     text that might contain such characters in HTML.</p> filesizeformat function (value, binary, bytes, base, prefixes, i, prefix, unit) <p>Format the value like a 'human-readable' file size (i.e. 13 kB,     4.1 MB, 102 Bytes, etc).  Per default decimal prefixes are used (Mega,     Giga, etc.), if the second parameter is set to <code>True</code> the binary     prefixes are used (Mebi, Gibi).</p> first function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Return the first item of a sequence.</p> float function (value, default) <p>Convert the value into a floating point number. If the     conversion doesn't work it will return <code>0.0</code>. You can     override this default using the first parameter.</p> forceescape function (value) <p>Enforce HTML escaping.  This will probably double escape variables.</p> format function (value, args, kwargs) <p>Apply the given values to a <code>printf-style</code>_ format string, like     <code>string % values</code>.</p> groupby function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's     :func:<code>itertools.groupby</code>. The attribute can use dot notation for     nested access, like <code>\"address.city\"</code>. Unlike Python's <code>groupby</code>,     the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each     unique value.</p> indent function (s, width, first, blank, newline, rv, lines) <p>Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The     first line and blank lines are not indented by default.</p> int function (value, default, base) <p>Convert the value into an integer. If the     conversion doesn't work it will return <code>0</code>. You can     override this default using the first parameter. You     can also override the default base (10) in the second     parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as     0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively.     The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values.</p> join function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the     sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per     default, you can define it with the optional parameter.</p> last function (environment, seq) <p>Return the last item of a sequence.</p> length builtin_function_or_method <p>Return the number of items in a container.</p> list function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Convert the value into a list.  If it was a string the returned list     will be a list of characters.</p> lower function (s) <p>Convert a value to lowercase.</p> items function (value) <p>Return an iterator over the <code>(key, value)</code> items of a mapping.</p> map function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute.     This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really     only interested in a certain value of it.</p> min function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute) <p>Return the smallest item from the sequence.</p> max function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute) <p>Return the largest item from the sequence.</p> pprint function (value) <p>Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging.</p> random function (context, seq) <p>Return a random item from the sequence.</p> reject function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> rejectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test     succeeding.</p> replace function (eval_ctx, s, old, new, count) <p>Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring     replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring     that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string.     If the optional third argument <code>count</code> is given, only the first     <code>count</code> occurrences are replaced.</p> reverse function (value, rv, e) <p>Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other     way round.</p> round function (value, precision, method, func) <p>Round the number to a given precision. The first     parameter specifies the precision (default is <code>0</code>), the     second the rounding method.</p> safe function (value) <p>Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic     escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped.</p> select function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> selectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the     test succeeding.</p> slice function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing     those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing     three ul tags that represent columns.</p> sort function (environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func) <p>Sort an iterable using Python's :func:<code>sorted</code>.</p> string function (s) <p>Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves     a :class:<code>Markup</code> string rather than converting it back to a basic     string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped     again.</p> striptags function (value) <p>Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space.</p> sum function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter     'start' (which defaults to 0).  When the sequence is empty it returns     start.</p> title function (s, item) <p>Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with     uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase.</p> trim function (value, chars) <p>Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace.</p> truncate function (env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result) <p>Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified     with the first parameter which defaults to <code>255</code>. If the second     parameter is <code>true</code> the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise     it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact     truncated it will append an ellipsis sign (<code>\"...\"</code>). If you want a     different ellipsis sign than <code>\"...\"</code> you can specify it using the     third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance     margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated.</p> unique function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable.</p> upper function (s) <p>Convert a value to uppercase.</p> urlencode function (value, items) <p>Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8.</p> urlize function (eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, extra_schemes, policies, rel_parts, scheme, rv) <p>Convert URLs in text into clickable links.</p> wordcount function (s) <p>Count the words in that string.</p> wordwrap function (environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens, textwrap, line) <p>Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated     as paragraphs to be wrapped separately.</p> xmlattr function (eval_ctx, d, autospace, items, key, value, rv) <p>Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict.</p> tojson function (eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumps, kwargs) <p>Serialize an object to a string of JSON, and mark it safe to     render in HTML. This filter is only for use in HTML documents.</p>"},{"location":"backend/symbols.html","title":"Military Symbol Test","text":""},{"location":"backend/symbols.html#military-symbol-test","title":"Military Symbol Test","text":"<p>Below is a list of all letters A\u2013Z.
