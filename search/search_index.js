The attribute can use dot notation for     nested access, like <code>\"address.city\"</code>. Unlike Python's <code>groupby</code>,     the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each     unique value.</p> indent function (s, width, first, blank, newline, rv, lines) <p>Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The     first line and blank lines are not indented by default.</p> int function (value, default, base) <p>Convert the value into an integer. If the     conversion doesn't work it will return <code>0</code>. You can     override this default using the first parameter. You     can also override the default base (10) in the second     parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as     0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively.     The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values.</p> join function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the     sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per     default, you can define it with the optional parameter.</p> last function (environment, seq) <p>Return the last item of a sequence.</p> length builtin_function_or_method <p>Return the number of items in a container.</p> list function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Convert the value into a list.  If it was a string the returned list     will be a list of characters.</p> lower function (s) <p>Convert a value to lowercase.</p> items function (value) <p>Return an iterator over the <code>(key, value)</code> items of a mapping.</p> map function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute.     This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really     only interested in a certain value of it.</p> min function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute) <p>Return the smallest item from the sequence.</p> max function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute) <p>Return the largest item from the sequence.</p> pprint function (value) <p>Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging.</p> random function (context, seq) <p>Return a random item from the sequence.</p> reject function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> rejectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test     succeeding.</p> replace function (eval_ctx, s, old, new, count) <p>Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring     replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring     that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string.     If the optional third argument <code>count</code> is given, only the first     <code>count</code> occurrences are replaced.</p> reverse function (value, rv, e) <p>Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other     way round.</p> round function (value, precision, method, func) <p>Round the number to a given precision. The first     parameter specifies the precision (default is <code>0</code>), the     second the rounding method.</p> safe function (value) <p>Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic     escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped.</p> select function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> selectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the     test succeeding.</p> slice function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing     those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing     three ul tags that represent columns.</p> sort function (environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func) <p>Sort an iterable using Python's :func:<code>sorted</code>.</p> string function (s) <p>Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves     a :class:<code>Markup</code> string rather than converting it back to a basic     string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped     again.</p> striptags function (value) <p>Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space.</p> sum function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter     'start' (which defaults to 0).  When the sequence is empty it returns     start.</p> title function (s, item) <p>Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with     uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase.</p> trim function (value, chars) <p>Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace.</p> truncate function (env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result) <p>Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified     with the first parameter which defaults to <code>255</code>. If the second     parameter is <code>true</code> the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise     it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact     truncated it will append an ellipsis sign (<code>\"...\"</code>). If you want a     different ellipsis sign than <code>\"...\"</code> you can specify it using the     third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance     margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated.</p> unique function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable.</p> upper function (s) <p>Convert a value to uppercase.</p> urlencode function (value, items) <p>Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8.</p> urlize function (eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, extra_schemes, policies, rel_parts, scheme, rv) <p>Convert URLs in text into clickable links.</p> wordcount function (s) <p>Count the words in that string.</p> wordwrap function (environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens, textwrap, line) <p>Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated     as paragraphs to be wrapped separately.</p> xmlattr function (eval_ctx, d, autospace, items, key, value, rv) <p>Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict.</p> tojson function (eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumps, kwargs) <p>Serialize an object to a string of JSON, and mark it safe to     render in HTML. This filter is only for use in HTML documents.</p>"},{"location":"backend/symbols.html","title":"Military Symbol Test","text":""},{"location":"backend/symbols.html#military-symbol-test","title":"Military Symbol Test","text":"<p>Below is a list of all letters A\u2013Z.
