As the force Commander, you will plan and then issue orders and Standard Operating Procedures to your battalion, brigade, or regimental forces shaping the fight by maneuver and your intent. Your forces will engage the enemy on rendered real-world map locations. Each hex is 500m of militarily significant terrain. Each battle can last 4 to 24 hours of in-game time. Your troops will meet their foes any time of day and in any environment. </p> <p>The game engine is based on asynchronous WEGO turns. This means you will issue orders and then watch a variable amount of time unfold on the battlefield. Then issue or adjust orders to react to what has happened as you execute your battleplan. </p> <p>Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War is a deep simulation of combat operations where your forces are arranged in maneuver units of companies, platoons, and sections of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry squads and teams, recon forces, engineers, air-defense and anti-tank systems, helicopters and more. As the Commander, you must use available off-map assets like long-range artillery, rockets, or airstrikes. </p> <p>Your efforts in this complex battlespace will be constantly challenged by modeled features like Electronic Warfare, Air Superiority, Realistic Weather, Line of Sight and Fire, Terrain and Elevation, Smoke and Mines, and Human Factors like training, morale, and readiness. All these elements must be considered if you are to be victorious on the battlefield. </p> <p>The game is packed with information dialogs, map overlays, and range rings to aid you as Commander, master the situation, and understand your force\u2019s capabilities.</p> <p>Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War is a data-rich simulation where each nation has information on National Characteristics, Command Parameters, and Orders of Battle. Data Tables are packed with era-specific equipment and troops. Weapon Systems of the time, such as guns, missiles, precision munitions, small arms, and much more, are comprehensively modeled. </p> <p>As a toolkit, you can create your own scenarios and campaigns. You can also dive deeper and create or modify game data, artwork, and sound effects as you see fit. All these modding capabilities are supported by detailed documentation.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#gender-pronouns-and-inclusion","title":"Gender Pronouns and Inclusion","text":"<p>We understand that users of all genders will play our simulation.

At a range of one hex, there is an increased chance of getting a flank attack on a target unit as some of the subunits are assumed to be close enough and, in a position, where flank shots are possible. If both the attacker and defender are in hex, attacks have a better chance to be flank or rear aspect shots as cover and spacing allow for more advantageous engagements.

Spotting is checked for all units and then each unit with Assault, Hold, Screen, Move-Deliberate, Move-Hasty, or Direct Support orders looks for suitable targets among the enemy units that it can sight directly or indirectly in some cases. A combat event for each pairing of attacker and defender is created and entered in the main game event queue. </p> <p>The combat event is resolved between the two units at the subunit level. The attacking unit calculates the quality and quantity of fire that it can effectively protect against the defender given the number of subunits that it has, the armaments that they mount and their effectiveness versus the target subunit, the range to the target, armaments base accuracy, attacker orders, crew quality, suppression from incoming fire, multiple targets, and special bonuses such as advanced gun sights. </p> <p>This effective projection of fire is applied to the defending unit which will take losses about the quantity and intrinsic protection rating of its runners, defender orders, posture, usable terrain bonus, movement, stealth, range, and special bonuses such as armor (Chobham, advanced composite, laminated, or reactive). The defender is also penalized if he has not sighted the attacker - surprise is assumed for the first few shots - and if the range is one or less then there is a further penalty due to the assumption that more flanking shots are available when at such close range. </p> <p>The attacker uses up munitions by the round or burst used to engage the enemy and is marked as \u201cfiring\u201d. This \u201cfiring\u201d status makes it easier for other units to spot it during the turn.

Units occasionally gain a boost to morale if they achieve kills without taking losses. </p> <p>Defending units can take losses because of combat. These losses are tracked to individual subunits. Readiness and morale will both be degraded in these cases. Morale can take a bigger hit if the HQ is out of range or if a friendly unit within 1000 meters is wiped out.</p> <p>Units are not mindless zombies that die to the last subunit. If losses in the unit are too great and readiness and morale are low, a unit will spontaneously give up its mission orders and try to retreat to a safer location by scooting.</p>"},{"location":"FieldManuals/game-operations/combat-operations.html#indirect-fires-idf","title":"Indirect Fires (IDF)","text":"<p>Where direct fires have the shooter seeing the target, indirect fires rely on another unit to spot a target and provide targeting information for the indirect fire units to use to shoot with. The advantage of indirect fire is its much longer ranges and less exposure to direct combat.</p> <p>Indirect fires are guns, rockets, and mortars that fire munitions (or are munitions in the case of rockets) over the battlefield.</p> <p>These systems show up on the map as various explosion animations in the target hex based on the type of munitions used. In our earlier games, artillery fired in a piecemeal fashion with several rounds being resolved each turn they attacked. Now, each gun fires rounds, and the attack lasts over a duration as shells are fired until the mission is over. This means enemy units can move into and out of the hex(es) being attacked. In some cases, the fire will be adjusted to follow targets if they are under direct observation and there are timely communications with the observer and shooter.</p> <p>Artillery fire missions can be of a few types as noted below:</p> <p>Direct Fire \u2013 Some field gun-equipped artillery platforms can point themselves at an enemy and fire directly. The wisdom of this is highly debatable but it can be done. Interestingly, Soviet tactics put great store in this technique and 122mm and 152mm SP howitzer assets can be attached to their assault formations to use direct fire against targets. While it is certainly much quicker than trying to organize on-call fire the cost to the lightly protected artillery would be horrendous. They used this technique extensively in the second half of WW2 with the SU-76 (76mm guns mounted in light tank chassis) and the 2S1 and 2S3 vehicles are the Cold War inheritors of that tradition. All other force structures might want to consider this a measure of last resort.</p> <p>Pre-Plotted Fires \u2013 These fire missions represent pre-registered targets for the artillery units to shoot at the start of a battle. For the AI player, the artillery barrages need to be set up in the Scenario Editor to start right at the start of the battle. For the player, this kind of strike needs to be plotted in the Setup Phase before the start of the battle and will start falling right when the first turn is executed. </p> <p>Direct Support \u2013 These are artillery assets that are dedicated to supporting a selected unit or set of units. These assets will not take on fire support requests from other units or provide counter-battery fires and are ready to perform fire missions only for the enemy units spotted by the units placed in direct support. These missions usually have slightly shorter command delays than the General Support operations.</p> <p>General Support \u2013 These are artillery assets that will take requests for fire from any friendly unit on the map and process them based on target type, urgency, and availability via the FSCC. Standard command delays exist for this type of support.</p> <p>Counter Battery \u2013 These assets are set to fire on located enemy artillery units that are in the range of the counter-battery unit.

Line units will automatically generate fire support requests during the turn resolution based on their sighting activities as the turn unfolds. Fire support requests are also generated by the staff when ordered to prepare a fire support plan as part of the AI planning cycle. </p> <p>Fire support requests are rated for target type, priority, and weight of fire, type of munition needed, and are queued in descending order of importance (priority multiplied by weight of fire requested). Fire support requests are discarded if the target is lost or too much time passes between the initial call and the unit being able to shoot. This is done so as not to waste ammunition shelling the empty ground. </p> <p>During turn resolution, the FSCC is called to match fire support requests to available air and artillery assets. To be \u201cavailable\u201d an artillery unit must have an On Call, Direct Support, or Counter Battery order and otherwise be ready to fire (i.e., not wiped out, not moving, not already assigned an FSCC mission, etc.) or be an On-Call aircraft. </p> <p>Other missions are served first by eligible artillery units with Direct Support orders, then by General Support units, and finally by units with counter-battery orders if they are available.</p> <p>Available air and artillery units are assigned to the mission until the requested weight of fire has been accumulated. The necessary combat events are created in the game event queue and the selected units will fire.

For game purposes, we assume a tactical nuclear capability of approximately a 10kt yield with a 2 km blast radius. Subunits will be eliminated based on distance from the blast center by their intrinsic protection rating, NBC rating, cover, and posture. Units also suffer massive losses in both readiness and morale even if they survive the blast and are automatically contaminated with radiation. Contamination can cause additional losses over time if not dealt with in a short time after the attack. All bridges, smoke clouds, minefields, and chemical contamination within the blast zone will be eliminated.</p> <p>The ground will be contaminated with two hexes from the blast center for the rest of the game. Units moving through the contaminated zones run the risk of additional losses and get contaminated. All helicopters within a 5 km radius will be eliminated by the blast\u2019s shock wave. To decontaminate units, they must enter a Resupply order and spend time being cleared of the hazard.</p> <p>Persistent Chemical Weapons - A persistent chemical strike consists of various nerve or blood agents that can quickly incapacitate or kill exposed troops. Units caught in a persistent chemical attack can suffer losses based on their NBC rating take a considerable loss of readiness while getting into protective gear (MOPP suits) and suffer additional morale loss from the attack. Persistent chemical strikes leave markers on the map for the rest of the game. Any units moving through are attacked and contaminated. Like nuclear contamination, chemical contamination can be removed by a resupply order. Contaminated units fight with reduced combat effectiveness caused by the protective gear.</p> <p>Non-Persistent Chemical Weapons - A non-persistent chemical strike consists of various nerve or blood agents that can quickly incapacitate or kill exposed troops. Units caught in a non-persistent chemical attack can suffer losses based on their NBC rating take a significant loss of readiness while getting into protective gear (MOPP suits) and suffer additional morale loss from the attack.

These functions are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Headquarters - Headquarters units are the command network of your forces. These units are the ones that draw up plans and issue orders to their subordinate forces or relay orders to other forces. Keeping these units alive and in command range of their subordinates will have a significant impact on your force\u2019s ability to fight and win battles. Most upper-level headquarters are full of troops, trucks, and command vehicles and not meant to fight toe-to-toe with enemy units.</li> </ul> <p>Lower-level headquarters for companies and platoons usually have the same type of units as those they command, like tanks, and can lend firepower during a battle. Headquarters have some of the following abilities:</p> <ul> <li>Each order sent out to a unit and each situation report back from a unit is a \u201cradio event\u201d. Excessive use of the radio can reveal a unit\u2019s location and it will be shown on the map in a \u2018detected\u2019 spotted state if it is not detected already. If the unit is an HQ and the enemy staff are enabled to give FSCC missions, then a high-priority fire request against the HQ will be entered into the enemy FSCC mission queue. The bottom line, move your HQs on occasion if order traffic is high or risk getting them shelled. </li> <li>If an HQ unit is destroyed, then another unit will be promoted to fill its spot in the chain of command. This is called HQ subordination. Any unit that has subordinate units is a de-facto headquarters unit, whether it is officially described as such or not. This state is not dependent on having HQ vehicles as subunits. </li> <li>The Chain of Command chart on the Map Page will show what the unit hierarchies currently are. The highest HQ (marked with \u201cHQ\u201d as its unit icon) is in the overall command. Depending on the situation there may be intermediate level HQs as well. </li> <li>HQ units can indirectly sight any enemy unit that its subordinate units have sighted. The highest HQ sights everything that any friendly unit has sighted. This is important for generating FSCC requests and reflecting passing sightings of the enemy up the command chain. </li> <li>Involuntary Movement: When a unit is forced to retreat it will move in the direction of immediate safety, or if there is none, towards its parent HQ.</li> <li>Engineering \u2013 Engineering units are used to do specific tasks such as laying a bridge over a stream or river, clearing mines and obstacles, and blowing bridges to deny their use to the enemy. One of the significant changes from the earlier version of the game is the use of dedicated engineering assets on the map to do those functions listed above. This includes information reports dedicated to engineering assets and activities.</li> </ul> <p>Currently supported in the game are dedicated short-span bridging units and engineering troops. The bridges are used to cross water obstacles and the engineering troops do all the other functions. These units usually travel in the rear of the forces and then move up to do specific tasks. These are not combat-capable units and should not be placed into combat with the enemy.</p> <ul> <li>Artillery \u2013 Artillery is the King of Battle. These weapon systems represent guns, rockets, and mortars that can reach tens if not hundreds of kilometers into enemy territory and deliver several different types of munitions on targets with devastating effect. These assets can also be on or off-map depending on the scenario design. Several reports and information panels such as the Fire Support panel provide details on these units and allow you to see what they are doing and access to order them to fire on targets of your choosing. There is also an option to have these assets placed under FSCC (Fire Support Control Center) control which will use the AI to direct their fires on spotted enemy units. When these units are on the map, they should be placed behind your forces but in range of the enemy to be able to fire on them. Artillery units can, when pressed and capable (noted as direct fire capable and carrying the right ammunition), engage in direct fire against attacking units. Artillery units both on and off-map can be subjected to enemy counter-battery fire. This is returned enemy artillery fire based on locating your firing batteries via counter-battery radars and other means. It would be best if you got in the habit of shooting and then moving to avoid losses.</li> <li>__On-Map Air Support - __Various types of helicopters are included in the game. There are Attack, Recon, and Utility versions of Helicopters. Helicopters can carry a variety of weapons geared to anti-armor or anti-personnel missions, but they can also be assigned to perform reconnaissance tasks. In future updates, we will add the utility/transport helicopters for airborne assault operations. Helicopters are just like any other on-map unit except for the following differences:</li> <li>They ignore all terrain costs when moving.</li> <li>They move much faster than the ground units based on their cruise speed and flight profile.</li> <li>Depending on movement orders, helicopters will fly Nap of the Earth (NOE) using terrain to screen and cover their movements when Hunting (a helicopter-specific order for moving and attacking enemy targets) or doing a Deliberate Move. They will fly at low altitude if executing a hasty move.</li> <li>They do not count against stacking limits in the location they occupy.</li> <li>They do not suffer NBC (Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological) attacks if they move through a contaminated hex location.</li> <li>They do not suffer minefield attacks if they move through a mined location.</li> <li>Unit Posture \u2013 Helicopter units cannot dig in or fortify.</li> <li>Helicopters with mast-mounted sensors receive a bonus to spot and a bonus not to get spotted when looking for enemy units.</li> <li>To resupply, helicopters must fly back and land at a FARP (Forward Arming and Refueling Point) unit. If the FARP is missing, then the units will go to the current highest HQ on the map to resupply.</li> <li>__Off-Map Air Support - __Off-Map Air support is units of propeller or jet-powered aircraft with various missions designed to strike targets on the battlefield. All aircraft are held off-map, in particular, loiter areas for commitment to air strikes under the player\u2019s direction or FSCC control. When the air strike is complete the surviving aircraft either return to base to rearm if out of ammunition or go back on station if weapons are still available. After rearming they will return to the loiter area to await future assignments. The doctrine generally allows for a certain number of fixed-wing air close air support sorties within 40 km or so of the Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA). Since the FEBA is an extremely high-risk area for these valuable assets, availability will be limited, and strikes should be reserved for high-value targets. Long-range artillery and helicopter assets remain the preferred platforms for routine fire missions within this zone. Off-map strike aircraft have the following capabilities:</li> <li>Aircraft that are rated All-Weather can fly anytime visibility is 500 meters or better (in rain/snow). Non-All-Weather aircraft are grounded if the weather is poor. </li> <li>Aircraft that are rated for Night Operations can fly normally at night. Those units without this rating are grounded and cannot fly at night.</li> <li>Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft are equipped to strike ground targets.</li> <li>Level Bombers fly high over the battlefield and drop weapons against ground targets.</li> <li>SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) aircraft are equipped with special anti-radiation missiles (ARMs) that seek out and destroy air search radars rendering Surface to Air systems (SAMs) useless. They do not affect optical and infrared (IR) systems.</li> <li>Most scenarios will have a limited number of air strikes (if any) and those assets will be available for a limited amount of time.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"FieldManuals/game-operations/spotting-and-line-of-sight-los.html","title":"Spotting and Line of Sight (LOS)","text":""},{"location":"FieldManuals/game-operations/spotting-and-line-of-sight-los.html#spotting-and-line-of-sight-los","title":"Spotting and Line of Sight (LOS)","text":"<p>Note: Images omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>The ability to detect, that is distinguish between a military platform and its surroundings is heavily impacted by illumination, especially when not equipped with excellent Thermal Imaging or Night Vision equipment.</p> <p>So, the gameplay panel gives you weather conditions and weather/meteorological visibility.

It is an integral part of the command dilemma to be able to ration it out effectively.</p> <p>In game terms, resupply is presumed to occur whenever a unit receives Resupply orders and there is a lull in the action, and the supply trucks and other vehicles can come forward and provide ammo and fuel to combat vehicles in place. Alternatively, individual vehicles drive a short distance to the rear to resupply and then return to their original location. </p> <p>As stated earlier, for a unit to resupply, it must be clear of enemy units and combat. Units within the command radius of their HQ can get fully resupplied on ammo and gain more readiness and morale recovery.

The size indicators are \u201cX\u201d = brigade, \u201cIII\u201d = regiment, \u201cII\u201d = battalion, \u201cI\u201d = company (approx. 10 subunits), \u201c...\u201d = platoon (approx. 3-5 subunits), \u201c..\u201d section (1 or 2 subunits), and \u201c.\u2019 = an individual subunit. This information is shown only to the owning player. NOTE: For headquarters units, the unit size shown is the size of the command, not of the HQ unit itself. </li> <li>National Color \u2013 Every unit of a nation has a color-coded background for the unit counters. The Soviets are red, the Americans are green, and the French are blue. Each nation\u2019s background is unique and allows the players to tell the various forces apart.</li> <li>Is Headquarter Unit - The \u201cH\u201d in the upper right corner means that this unit is a headquarters unit. Some are formally organized to be headquarters, and some are just acting as such. In either case, an H will appear in this location. This information is shown only to the owning player. These units provide the chain of command and communications link to their subordinates.</li> <li>Active Emitter \u2013 If a unit is equipped with a Radar system, either Air Search or Ground Search and it is activated, an orange box will be displayed on the counter to show an active emitter.</li> <li>Unit Order - The white letter (\u201cM\u201d) in the lower right of the counter indicates the unit\u2019s current Order. Valid orders are the following: \u201cA\u201d = Assault, \u201cM\u201d = Move - Deliberate, \u201c2\u201d = Move - Hasty, \u201cS\u201d = Screen, \u201cH\u201d = Hold, \u201cB\u201d = Barrage, \u201cG\u201d for Gas Attack, \u201cC\u201d = Counter-Battery, \u201cE\u201d = Engineering Action, \u201cR\u201d = Resupply, \u201cO\u201d = On the call, \u201cF\u201d for Fallback (Scooting), \u201cW\u201d for Withdrawing, and \u201cZ\u201d for helicopters that are in Hunt mode. This information is shown only to the owning player. These orders will be explained in more detail in Section 21 below. </li> <li>Spotted Indicator - If the unit has been sighted by the enemy, then a tiny white dot will be drawn at the bottom of the counter to the left of the unit order. This is based on being lazed, shot at, or a reasonable estimation of \u201cwe see them so I bet they can see us\u201d for your units and spotting the enemy. NOTE: This indicator will only show if the option to Show Enemy Units is turned on.</li> <li> <p>Movement Direction and Type - If a unit is currently in motion, then a small triangle will be shown pointing in the direction that will be moved in next. If the triangle is black, the unit is utilizing road movement via a hasty move order and is going for speed over combat readiness. A blue triangle indicates a Deliberate Move order, and the unit is moving slower and will use both road and off-road movements to the objective while being ready for combat. A red triangle indicates a unit moving in an Assault order and is combat-ready. Assault movement is a bit faster than a deliberate trading cover for speed to close on an objective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Number of Active Runners - The large number in the bottom left corner is the number of subunits mission-capable (\u201c10\u201d in this example). A subunit is mission-capable (also known as a \u201crunner\u201d) if it is physically and psychologically able to carry out its orders. The other possible states are destroyed and fallen out. A tank that has thrown a track, a truck with a conked-out engine, or an infantry squad so shattered that it cannot rise from the bottom of its trench are examples of subunits that have fallen out. Fallen-out subunits count equally with destroyed subunits for victory purposes but can be recovered between scenarios in a campaign game. </p> </li> <li>Movement Class \u2013 The letter in the upper left of the counter indicates the unit\u2019s current movement type. These types are as follows: \u201cL\u201d = Leg, \u201cW\u201d = Wheeled, \u201cT\u201d = Tracked, \u201cR\u201d = Rotor, \u201cP\u201d = Propeller, \u201cJ\u201d = Jet, \u201cR\u201d = Rocket, \u201cS\u201d = Static (non-movable).</li> </ul> <p>NOTE: See Section 22.1.3 below for details on the Lost Transport Indicator.</p>"},{"location":"FieldManuals/game-operations/user-preferences.html","title":"User Preferences","text":""},{"location":"FieldManuals/game-operations/user-preferences.html#user-preferences","title":"User Preferences","text":"<p>Note: Images omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Clicking on the \u201cUser Preferences...\u201d button will open a dialog box with four tabs of settings information for various game functions.

You need to mark the far side of the crossing. You can place multiple crossing locations. The computer player may attempt multiple simultaneous crossings (which is wise when the crossing is opposed) if the task force has multiple bridge layers, preferably in separate groups. The computer player can identify alternative crossings, perhaps 5km away, and decide not to bridge.  </li> </ol> <p>(Since we don't have \"sector boundaries\" the computer player won't understand that alternative crossings are not viable. Since bridges are scarce, the computer player cannot use the Red Storm mechanism of constructing a bridge every time it runs into a water obstacle).</p> <p>The second example will be C 1-16 INF (Armor) with an engineer bridge short span attached to the company.</p> <p>I want to change the \u201cOrder of March\u2019 in the company by selecting the \u201cReorder\u201d and moving the Engineer unit and placing it behind the 1/C/1-16 and then followed by the 2/C/1-16 and 3/C/1-16. </p> <p>After attaching an Engineer Bridging Unit to C/1-6 (Armor), hold the \u201cCtrl\u201d key down and left-click on the Tank Company HQ, and all the units within the company are selected as shown in Fig. 41.</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Fig. 41</p> <p>The reason for doing that is I want to use large selections for the Set SOP and Adjust SOP mechanisms which have been designed to work with large selections of units. Even when you want to apply different changes to the HQ and line units of a group. It is quicker to select the whole group, apply changes to the whole group and confirm, then apply another SOP preset to the line units, exclude the HQ, and confirm. Finally, by selecting an SOP preset for the HQ, invert the selection including the HQ, and confirm. That way, you end up with the whole group still being selected, and ready to accept a group move order.</p> <p>Another thing to remember is how to use the \u201cMovement Orders\u201d and the \u201cNon-Movement Orders\u201d as shown in Fig. 42.</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Fig. 42</p> <p>If you want your units to behave differently \u201cOn the Move\u201d compared to when they arrived and were in place. For example, to have your tank units quickly move into their screen and fight positions, you want them to use the roads. But once screening, you want them to fall back via locations and paths offering concealment.</p> <p>To do so, select the tank units and adjust the SOP to prefer road movement for all SOPs (all checked as shown in Fig. 42).</p> <p>Next issue the movements to the screening positions. Finally, select the tank units, adjust the SOP to not care about road movements, prefer concealed movement, and apply the changes only to the Defaults SOP and Non-Movement Orders, so you need to uncheck the Movement Orders.</p> <p>For a quick inspection of specific actual Sop settings in your selection. For example, to check which units are set to \u201cMaximum Range\u201d, select the relevant units, then use the Adjust SOP and choose any Fire Discipline.

Unfortunately, the engineer bridge layer will not recover the bridge to continue with the C/1-16 mission. Just add more bridge layers to the task force. That feels safer and is more robust than removing the bridge from the obstacle you just crossed, disconnecting you from supply and reinforcements (and perhaps stragglers from your formation still on the wrong side of the obstacle).</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Fig. 48</p> <p>One thing to remember is because we don't have \"sector boundaries\" the computer player won't understand that alternative crossings are not viable. That is why I had to destroy bridges so that the unit would have to hold in a position until the bridge was laid as shown in Fig. 47. If the bridges weren\u2019t blown the units would cross over the other bridges and ignore the Engineer unit.</p>"},{"location":"Guides/battle-planning/creating-battle-plans.html#helicopters","title":"Helicopters","text":"<p>Feature to be added in a future expansion.</p>"},{"location":"Guides/battle-planning/getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"Guides/battle-planning/getting-started.html#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>Note: Images omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>\u201cThe process of battle planning involves utilizing a straightforward visual scripting system to enhance the existing artificial intelligence of computer players.

Your forces will engage the enemy on rendered real-world map locations. Each hex is 500m of militarily significant terrain. Each battle can last 4 to 24 hours of in-game time. Your troops will meet their foes any time of day and in any environment. </p> <p>The game engine is based on asynchronous WEGO turns. This means you will issue orders and then watch a variable amount of time unfold on the battlefield. Then, issue or adjust orders to react to what has happened as you execute your battle plan. </p> <p>Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War is a deep simulation of combat operations where your forces are arranged in maneuver units of companies, platoons, and sections of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry squads and teams, recon forces, engineers, air-defense and anti-tank systems, helicopters and more. As the Commander, you must use available off-map assets like long-range artillery, rockets, or airstrikes. </p> <p>Your efforts in this complex battlespace will be constantly challenged by modeled features like Electronic Warfare, Air Superiority, Realistic Weather, Line of Sight and Fire, Terrain and Elevation, Smoke and Mines, and Human Factors like training, morale, and readiness. All these elements must be considered if you are to be victorious on the battlefield. </p> <p>The game is packed with information dialogs, map overlays, and range rings to aid you as Commander, master the situation, and understand your force\u2019s capabilities.</p> <p>Flashpoint Campaigns: Cold War is a data-rich simulation where each nation has information on National Characteristics, Command Parameters, and Orders of Battle. Data Tables are packed with era-specific equipment and troops. Weapon Systems of the time, such as guns, missiles, precision munitions, small arms, and much more, are comprehensively modeled. </p> <p>As a toolkit, you can create your own scenarios and campaigns. You can also dive deeper and create or modify game data, artwork, and sound effects as you see fit.

A bit of an eye chart but we will go over each one next as to what you can and can\u2019t do.</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <ol> <li>Name: This is the name of the unit seen on the counter and in any of the dialogs where a unit name is shown. This can be edited freely.</li> <li>Tag: This is the generated Tag ID from the Formation creation, and it is generally the same as the Name field. Edit to match the Name field if changed.</li> <li>Parent Name: This field tells which unit a sub-unit is subordinate too. To match up to an HQ unit this field needs to be the same as the Tag field of the commanding HQ. </li> <li>Nationality: This is the data folder name of the National Data Filename found in column \u201cU\u201d. If you are adding new units from a new National folder the name in column \u201cD\u201d and the XLS Filename in \u201cU\u201d must be named exactly as they are in the folder and file or the game will crash when it can\u2019t find the data. You can mix units from any number of nations in this manner. The subunits in column \u201cM\u201d must ALL come from the same national data file.</li> <li>% Ammo: You can set the percentage of ammo units in the scenario here. 0 to 125% are valid integer values to use.</li> <li>HQ Size: This is the same HQ size value found in the data editing information of Data Files. This represents the command level of the HQ, not the actual size of the HQ. </li> </ol> <p>Note</p> <p>__ the \u201c...\u201d symbol for a platoon is 3 periods and NOT the ellipse symbol. Excel will auto correct this if you do not change it in the Options/Proofing/Autocorrect Settings. Find the Ellipse correction, highlight it and then delete it.</p> <ol> <li>Icon Type: This is an internal value, and it should not be changed. If you are adding new units, you will want to add this in and try to match existing values seen in the scenario. For example, if you add and new Tank Company, you will want to use the \u201citTank\u201d reference.<ol> <li>Valid Icon Types are the following: itRecce, itHelo, itTank, itMechInf, itInf, itSPAT, itAntiTank, itHQ, itEngineer, itFlak, itSPArty, itArty, itTruck, itAir, itWMD, itDrone</li> </ol> </li> <li>Location: This is a 4-digit map coordinate or a \u201c0\u201d if the unit is off-map followed by /North(-) or South(+) distance in kilometers, /West(-) or East (+) distance in kilometers, and /0/0. </li> </ol> <p>Note</p> <p>__ It is possible to place a unit out of effective range adjusting these numbers and that can lead to a crash.

Valid integer values are 0 to 100.</li> <li>Readiness: You can change the Readiness value of any unit in this field. Valid integer values are 0 to 100.</li> <li>Training: You can change the Training value of any unit in this field. Valid integer values are 0 to 100.</li> <li>Unit Size: This is the actual size of the unit based on the number of subunits.<ol> <li>Valid Unit Sizes are the following: stArmy, stCorps, stDivision, stBrigade, stRegiment, stBattalion, stCompany, stBattery, stSquadron, stPlatoon, stSection, stSquad</li> </ol> </li> <li>Subunit ID List: This is the most edited column in many cases. This lists all the subunits by Tag ID from the National Data File referenced in Column \u201cU\u201d. You can add or remove any number of units in this field if they are from the noted data file. The last unit MUST have a trailing comma. </li> <li>Side: Units are either Side 0 (Blue) or Side 1 (Red). No other sides are currently supported.</li> <li>Force Index: Be careful editing this field. It matches up to the Force package in the scenario editor at an N+1 value. For example, a force index of 0 will be the Force 1 listing in the scenario editor. If you add units to an existing Force, they will inherit the Battleplanes of that force (if they have any). New Forces if created have no Battle Plans until they are created in the Scenario Editor.</li> <li>Arrival Offset in Mins (Minutes): A \u201c-1\u201d indicates that the unit starts on the map or off-map at the start of the scenario. Any integer time in minutes within the play time of the scenario can be used to set the arrival time of a reinforcement.</li> <li>Withdrawal Offset in Mins (Minutes): A \u201c-1\u201d indicates that the unit stays on the map or off-map for the duration of the scenario. Any integer time in minutes within the play time of the scenario can be used to set the withdrawal time \u201cX\u201d minutes into the scenario.</li> <li>Internal Values: DO NOT edit or attempt to add for new units.

We may try to move this to its own tab in the future.</li> </ol> <p>Warning</p> <p>__ changing ANY values in this field or adding or removing values will cause the game to crash if this file is imported with adjusted values.</p> <ol> <li>Unit Status: This is the game state of the unit. \u201cusActive\u201d is the default state of any unit that is in the scenario. You can also set to \u201cusInactive\u201d. This unit will not act until fired on or until it spots an enemy unit.

Starting small and simple, in many cases, is a good idea. If you want to change many things, you should take a minute and map out everything you need to do the job. Another factor involved is the end user. Is this something for you only, or will you make this for the public to use, too? Sometimes, it helps to be familiar with the process or tools. If you are great at digital artwork and have image editing tools, maybe changing some of the game art is a better place to start than making a new database. Either way you go, you need to have a desire to do it and, in some cases, support it after it is released.</p>"},{"location":"Guides/making-mods/getting-started.html#new-or-derived-content","title":"New or Derived Content","text":"<p>Where do you want to start? It is no doubt easier in almost every area of the game to derive/edit existing content than to start from scratch. If you are new to modding, I would strongly suggest starting a derived type of project first. Having data or a format in front of you helps reduce the chance of making a mistake. Once you are comfortable with all the ins and outs of creating the content you want from existing materials, you can switch to making it from scratch. If you create items from scratch, make sure you are aware of and follow the rules or guidelines for formats, sizes, and ranges. Failure to stay within the set boundaries of an object can lead to game crashes and the headaches of debugging what you have done.</p>"},{"location":"Guides/making-mods/getting-started.html#gathering-source-information","title":"Gathering Source Information","text":"<p>Before you launch into a project, take the time to gather supporting source information that can help you with what you are planning to do.

I don't know of a good way to solve this QGis, and just resort to a trial-and-error cycle of exporting to Flashpoint Campaigns and tweaking the Print Composer extents. As follows:</p> <p>Step 1. Export to the map for scanning by Flashpoint Campaigns using the current extents. In the Print Composer, use \"Composer\" Menu, Export as Image, and save the image, for example, to our project folder:</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Figure 40   xporting our map for scanning by the Flashpoint Campaigns Map Values Scanner as fcrs_minden.png</p> <p>In the next dialog, you should see the following settings (128dpi, width of approximately 2572 pixels).

Typically, the two will not line up perfectly, and we need to fix this in QGis.</p> <p>The offset in this case seems about 1/20<sup>th</sup> of a hex horizontally to the left and 1/50<sup>th</sup> of a hex vertically (down). For a 500m hex, the offset thus corresponds to approximately 25m horizontally, and 10m vertically.</p> <p>Switch back to QGis and our Print Composer. First fix the horizontal offset, subtracting 25m to the extents Xmin and Xmax:</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Figure 43   Tweaking the Print Composer extents to align with the game\u2019s grid</p> <p>With these extents, update the Print Composer (press Update preview), Repeat steps 1 and 2, also adjusting for vertical offset in Ymax and Ymin.</p> <p>Note: Image omitted \u2014 refer to original DOCX for figures.</p> <p>Figure 44   Offset reduced horizontally, but still requiring vertical tweaks...</p> <p>Rinse and repeat until you get it spot on. This takes me typically 3 to 8 tries.

Useful for debugging.</p> random function (context, seq) <p>Return a random item from the sequence.</p> reject function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> rejectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test     succeeding.</p> replace function (eval_ctx, s, old, new, count) <p>Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring     replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring     that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string.     If the optional third argument <code>count</code> is given, only the first     <code>count</code> occurrences are replaced.</p> reverse function (value, rv, e) <p>Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other     way round.</p> round function (value, precision, method, func) <p>Round the number to a given precision. The first     parameter specifies the precision (default is <code>0</code>), the     second the rounding method.</p> safe function (value) <p>Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic     escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped.</p> select function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> selectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the     test succeeding.</p> slice function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing     those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing     three ul tags that represent columns.</p> sort function (environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func) <p>Sort an iterable using Python's :func:<code>sorted</code>.</p> string function (s) <p>Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves     a :class:<code>Markup</code> string rather than converting it back to a basic     string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped     again.</p> striptags function (value) <p>Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space.</p> sum function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter     'start' (which defaults to 0).

Meanwhile, Panzerbataillon 362 (PzBtl 362) and Panzergrenadierbataillon 364 (PzGrenBtl 364) spearhead the brigade s renewed offensive effort.</p> <p>Version 1, Added BPs so that there are three per scenario.

Despite the heavy casualties sustained by Panzerbrigade 36 (PzBrig 36), Panzerbataillon 363 (PzBtl 363) retained sufficient strength to execute a bold and devastating raid deep into Soviet-held territory. Their assault struck at the heart of the enemy's logistics and command network, leaving the Soviet sector reeling.</p> <p>The 18<sup>th</sup> Guards Motorized Rifle Division (18 GMRD) commander was caught off guard. He had not anticipated such a decisive breakthrough by a relatively small NATO force. His defenses were ill-prepared to face such determined resistance this close to the German border. With his headquarters at risk, the Soviet general scrambled to stabilize his crumbling lines and protect his command.</p> <p>7By dawn, Jgerbataillon 126 (JgBtl 126) had reached PzBtl 363 northern flank. Ahead of them loomed rugged hills and dense forest, a landscape favoring the light infantry's expertise. Loaded with extra ammunition, the battalion prepared for a dangerous mission: infiltrate the hostile terrain northwest of Kronach to disrupt Soviet logistics and communications long after the main German force had moved on. The odds were grim; it was almost certainly a suicide mission. Yet, in the chaos of war, such operations had proven unexpectedly effective.</p> <p>With the 3<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Division (3ID) having accomplished its primary objective and inflicted significant damage on the Soviet forces, the time had come to regroup and return to the front lines.</p> <p>1But before that, one final raid awaited...</p>"},{"location":"Reference/Campaigns/WG1-SN7%20One%20Last%20Catfight.html","title":"One Last Catfight","text":""},{"location":"Reference/Campaigns/WG1-SN7%20One%20Last%20Catfight.html#one-last-catfight","title":"One Last Catfight","text":"<p>25 July 1989, 17:00 hrs, Kulmbach, West Germany   West Germans vs. Soviets, East Germans, and Czechoslovak Forces.</p> <p>The operation had been a hard-fought success. In a relentless sweep through the operational hinterland, Panzerbrigade 36 had inflicted significant damage on Warsaw Pact forces. Two Soviet divisions had been worn down, a third effectively annihilated, and critical supply chains running through the Coburg and Hof gaps were thrown into chaos. With luck, their actions would delay the Soviet advance by at least a day, buying precious time and weakening the effectiveness of the forward divisions.</p> <p>Now came the hard part withdrawal. Ivan wasn t making it easy. Despite Panzerbattaillon 363's stellar performance, the rest of the brigade had fared far worse. Panzerbattaillon 362 and Panzergrenadierbattaillon 364 had been battered by fierce counterattacks supported by overwhelming Soviet artillery. The situation grew even grimmer as brigade-sized Warsaw Pact forces pushed south from the border, rolling over the stretched defensive screens of West German and American troops.</p> <p>The U.S. 3<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Division had been forced back to the Bavarian border, while the 1<sup>st</sup> Armored Division was similarly mauled. With the dust settling over the battlefield, Panzerbrigade 36 stood alone, its flanks exposed and the enemy closing in.</p> <p>The situation was dire: ammunition reserves were critically low, the soldiers were utterly exhausted, casualties were mounting, and communications were becoming unreliable. Staying in place meant annihilation, while surrender was unthinkable. The only option left was to break out.</p> <p>Once again, Panzerbattaillon 363 was given the lead in the desperate mission to carve a path to safety.

Recon informed NATO that the 39<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Division was reorganizing its forces. It was assumed that this meant that NATO could expect an attack towards the city from the west along with a pincer movement from the South by the Czechoslovakian forces eventually linking up with the Soviets. This would not only isolate Nrnberg but also pocket a substantial number of NATO forces.\u00a0</p> <p>ENot wanting to be second-guessed, Pact command was thinking along different lines. The delay caused by the 39<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Division having to reorganize made the attack towards Nrnberg a problematic affair. NATO defenses had solidified to such an extent that there was a real danger of the 39<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Division being wiped out without getting anywhere near its objective. On the other hand, the attack on the Fulda Gap was showing great promise, and this was the determining factor in their decisions regarding the 39<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Division's future operations. \u00a0</p> <p>At the 39<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Division's HQ, there was a substantial degree of worry. There was some cautious optimism after the linking up with the 7<sup>th</sup> Panzer Division, but they were conscious that the 39<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Division had been seriously mauled in previous actions. With second-echelon forces arriving, they hoped that they would now fall into a support role. It was not meant to be. They were instructed to do a last push west. In what was seen by them as a sacrificial move, the division was to attack towards Bad-Windsheim. Deep reconnaissance showed a void being created between the NATO forward defense forces and the reinforcements. The 39<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Division was to exploit this hole. Their objective was to create as much chaos as possible and, as a secondary objective, to exploit in depth. Their much-battered regiments, having been consolidated and reassembled, once again were ready to plunge head-on into the NATO defenses.\u00a0</p> <p>WBad Windsheim had so far been a quiet area.

The 3<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Division was in the peculiar situation that operational boundary forces find themselves in. It had to keep an eye on the US V Army operations to the north and on the US VII Army operations to the South. Stretched between two different axes, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Division assigned the Bad Windsheim area to their 2<sup>nd</sup> Brigade. \u00a0</p> <p>The area had no particular claim to fame with regard to objectives. The main attraction was that an attacker entering through the north-east had a covered approach to the road network to the west of Bad Windsheim.

Arriving at the front in highly mobile groups, they took deep exploitation to heart and advanced, in some cases, carelessly forward. Less proficient commanders ended up with their groups demolished by air or land strikes, but competent commanders were posing real issues to the NATO defense forces.

The Czechoslovakian leadership had its own internal problems and could not help but feel that, whatever way events unfolded, the coming war would only make their internal problems harder. Their enthusiasm for the coming offensive was, at best, lukewarm. Alas, political realities, including a Soviet army deep inside Czechoslovakia, meant that they had to be pragmatic for the sake of their own survival. They were fortunate that, in this display of realpolitik, they had the support of the Security forces and of the Army.\u00a0</p> <p>4The Czechoslovakian Army had an ungrateful task in the war ahead. Unlike their East German allies, they would be attacking alone into a defense manned by the bulk of a West-German Panzer Grenadier Division, part of the US 1<sup>st</sup> Armored Division, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Cavalry Squadron. They also had one of the smaller concentrations of 1<sup>st</sup> echelon forces available, and the Soviet Army behind them would take a significant amount of time to reach the front, being more of a mobile reserve for the Soviet forces than a 2<sup>nd</sup> echelon for the Czechoslovakian forces. They were under no illusions that, within the Warsaw Pact's strategy, their task would be one of the most difficult to achieve. Despite this, the Army was determined to be successful in the task assigned to them. This was, of course, dictated by the fact that being on the winning side would be far easier for the political leadership than being on the losing side. The Army, in this, agreed with the politicians, and an alliance of need was born between them. They both staked their future on a positive outcome for the war.\u00a0</p> <p>sCzechoslovakian operations were planned to start later than the main attack originating from East Germany. The most important reason for this was to allow a concentration of air assets to develop air superiority over the attack corridors. As soon as the Czechoslovakian attack started, part of the Pact frontal aviation would switch to support them. In practice, because the Czechoslovakians feared that any delay in the aviation support would mean the bulk of their forces would be pummeled from the air at the border crossings, they only started to move en masse when the aviation was already doing its work. In practice, the result of these gaps was that the Czechoslovakian divisions ended up much more stretched and dispersed along their routes of advance. Their forward groups moved at the correct time. The remainder of the division forces was slower to start than scheduled. \u00a0</p> <p>WThe forward group of the 19<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Division was advancing south but in tandem with that of the 20<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Division. (Designer's Note: Refer to Campaign 1 for the operations of the 20<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Division.) The two groups moved rather swiftly over the border, making good use of the flat and vehicle-friendly terrain of the Weiden Gap. Making good use of the temporary air superiority over the area, their COs pushed their units to the limit, and, sooner than expected by NATO, the forward groups were clashing with the defending units as they were starting to consolidate their defenses.\u00a0</p> <p>_Windinscheschenbach is a town at the center of a valuable road network, including the Autobahn 93 to the east. Not only that, but it is also crossed by a north-south rail line that, south of the town, offers a multitude of crossings of the Waldnaab River. These crossings were the immediate target of the forward group of the 19<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Division.\u00a0</p> <p>KThe Brigade Commander of the 10<sup>th</sup> PzG Bde, whose task was to defend this area, was well aware that the bridges could become a target. The most obvious solution to the problem was to blow them. Unfortunately, this would mean stranding all of the refugees heading west and, at this early time, political and military indecision meant that this was not fully authorized, and the 101<sup>st</sup> PzG Bn / 10<sup>th</sup> PzG Bde would have to retain and defend the Autobahn 93 crossings in the vicinity of Windinscheschenbach. As the 19<sup>th</sup> MRD approached, these crossings became the focal point of the operations.</p>"},{"location":"Reference/Scenarios/Desperation.html","title":"Desperation","text":""},{"location":"Reference/Scenarios/Desperation.html#desperation","title":"Desperation","text":"<p>31 July 1989, 1000hrs, Hunfeld   West German vs Soviet forces</p> <p>NATO s counter attack continues to be successful and the Soviets are on their heels, getting pushed back across the front.

They were going to have to rely on aerial and artillery attacks to eliminate and harass the bridgehead forces. There was also concern over the gap south of Straubing. It was uncertain whether the Czechoslovakians would exploit it before the 4<sup>th</sup> PzG Division could plug it. The Divisional Commander of the 4<sup>th</sup> PzG Division wanted to consolidate his defense and counter-attack at first light on 22 July.

One such unit was the East German 17<sup>th</sup> Motor Rifle Division, a reserve unit that was recently brought up to strength and immediately sent forward to reinforce the fight.

Despite the scenic and peaceful landscape, the border was actually a massive defensive zone with a deadly system of barriers. Metal fences, coupled with barbed wire, warning devices, watch towers, and concrete walls, constituted a significant barrier to anyone thinking about crossing it. From its camp at Hof, vehicle and foot patrols were conducted, all under the watchful eye of helicopters. \u00a0</p> <p>On this evening, at the end of their patrol, the troopers of Ghost Troop reported that the sound of engines could be heard in the distance. This, by itself, was not unheard of. What was more alarming was that their short-range communications were being jammed adjacent to the border. As a report was filled and ready to send to 2 ACR HHT, the sound of low-flying jets on an east-west route could be heard. As the alert level was raised, Camp Harris was amongst the first targets for Soviet SSMs. The Camp was quickly engulfed by chaos as the war nobody expected would come crashing down from the sky. The camp reaction force quickly sprang into action, and the evacuation started in earnest. All contact with their higher HQ had been lost. \u00a0</p> <p>wWhat Ghost Troop heard was the approaching advance column of the Soviet 39<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Div. The Division Commander of the 39<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Div knew his task. He had the advantage over his peers that his division had one of the closest targets to reach. He had the disadvantage that he would have to cut across a sector that had forces from 4 different divisions of 2 different nationalities. He was banking on chaos and high tempo to allow him to quickly slice the enemy force in two while driving a deep wedge aimed first at Bamberg and afterward at Nrnberg. The Command Staff of the division spent an anxious 19<sup>th</sup> making sure that all last-minute preparations were in place. The CO and the political officer sat, for the first time in years, following the DFF evening broadcast. As soon as  Unser Sandmnnchen was canceled, the 39<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Div HQ exploded into a hive of activity.\u00a0</p> <p>The situation at the front developed reasonably quickly. As the NATO communications were jammed, Soviet forces breached the frontier whilst SSMs and tactical aviation pummeled high-value targets. Even though it was expected, it did not make the situation any less confusing, nor did it prevent chaos from ensuing. The throng of refugees started far quicker than NATO expected. The command paralysis in NATO was real due to indecision and the efficient communication jamming by the other side. Units at the front were temporarily left to their own devices. They had been trained to operate like this. But that did not prevent mistakes, inaction, or excess of zeal. \u00a0</p> <p>fThe 39<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Div came crashing down on the defense. Engineers and artillery made short work of the border obstacles. Within minutes, APCs and Tanks were rolling on West Germany. If there was one thing that the CO of the 39<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Div instilled in his junior officers, it was the need for tempo. The offensive could not stop. They had to advance, advance, advance. One thing that would be said in the future: he was blessed with officers who listened to him. The 39<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Div skirted Coburg, following parallel to the main road to Bamberg. They penetrated into a void in NATO's defense and advanced through a corridor bound by four NATO formations that initially expected each other to make the counter. The forward detachment knew it was vital to reach the Main and cross it as quickly as possible. That was just what they did. By this time, local NATO forces were also a hive of activity. NATO aerial forces had begun to offer a degree of protection. Jamming was also starting to be localized rather than a blanket. The commander of the West German PzG Bn 102 was still struggling to get clear orders or even a decent idea of what was happening around him. At about the same time, the advanced forces of the 39<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Div were approaching the main road connecting Bamberg to Bayreuth. Scouts from the PzG Bn 103 collided with them. In a moment of rash decision-making, the CO of the PzG Bn 102 decided to pull his scouts and launch a hasty attack with whatever forces he could quickly mobilize against the 39<sup>th</sup> Mechanized Div.

The sheer number of NATO forces on the Czechoslovakian border should have theoretically been more than enough to stop the Pact forces. NATO also banked on the belief that the Czechoslovakian forces would not be as sanguine towards the war as the remainder of the Pact. In practice, the Czechoslovakians proved to be tenacious attackers despite their natural handicap in equipment. Not only that, but they also made excellent use of the full width of the combat area, keeping a relentless advance despite the best efforts of NATO aviation. What ultimately started to tip the battle was that, with an inconclusive fight in their hands, the Soviet and Czechoslovakian second echelons were now nearing the border. This prompted NATO to start a strategic fighting retreat, whilst NATO's own second-echelon forces moved forward to plug the gaps.\u00a0</p> <p>Such was the strategic situation that the advance group of the Czechoslovakian 2<sup>nd</sup> Motorized Division found as they approached Amber from the south.
